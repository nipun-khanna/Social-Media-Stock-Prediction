2,1grqiw1,2024-11-15 06:49:43,Those who think removing the EV tax credit will help Tesla are smoking some exotic copium. Here's my crystal ball.,"1. Trump removes $7,500 EV tax credits and imposes import tariffs on all imported EVs.
2. The US EV manufacturers are starved out, and Tesla is the only surviving US EV maker - I quote ""Tesla does not depend on subsidies"".
3. Tesla increases its US EV market share, seemingly as the only car manufacturer without risk of discontinuity.
4. Nonetheless, Tesla delivery numbers remain stagnant despite increased US market share due to lowering overall EV sales.
5. Tesla now monopolises the US EV market, significantly diluting the need to compete.
6. US import tariffs are now in full effect. Imported parts are too expensive, and cost-cutting is prioritised. Tesla's costly R&D takes a backseat.
7. China, Korea and the Germans retaliate by imposing tariffs on Tesla imports, crippling Tesla's global market EV share.
8. Chinese, Korean and German EV makers continue to improve EV capabilities in a 3-cornered fight, widening the tech gap to Tesla.
9. The difference in EVs has now become more apparent. Tesla now lacks value for money and is no longer relevant to the global market. The US is dethroned as a major EV leader.
10. Tesla now struggles to sustain revenue growth without the global market. It now struggles to justify its colossal trillion-dollar valuation. Tesla needs to milk the already-drying US harder, somehow.
11. A new generation of Tesla bag holders is created.

  
Edit: Hundreds of ya all only read point 7 and started refuting how Tesla has factories in China and Germany, so there aren't tariffs, clear skies, etc. Look, when this trade war starts, these countries will want blood. Tesla is not only the US hallmark of EVs, but its flamboyant boss is now part of the US administration that initiated the sanctions. The countries, especially the Chinese, will hit where it hurts the most.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1grqiw1/those_who_think_removing_the_ev_tax_credit_will/

Just the sheer madness, i know its just a multiple and future growth and all that. Still, you gotta take a moment to contemplate this.

The funny thing is that Elon has outright lied/being wrong with predictions like dates for models and stuff, most recently the shenanigans with the robot at his events.

20,1b8rcun,2024-03-07 10:26:04,Tesla is a joke," I think Elon is lying to everyone again. He claims the tesla bot will be able to work a full day on a 2.3kwh battery. Full load on my mediocre Nvidia 3090 doing very simple AI inference runs up about 10 kwh in 24 hours. Mechanical energy expenditure and sensing aside, there is no way a generalized AI can run a full workday on 2.3kwh.

Now, you say that all the inference is done server side, and streamed back in forth to the robot. Let's say that cuts back energy expense enough to only being able to really be worrying about mechanical energy expense and sensing (dubious and generous). Now this robot lags even more than the limitations of onboard computing, and is a safety nightmare. People will be crushed to death before the damn thing even senses what it is doing.

That all being said, the best generalist robots currently still only have 3-6 hour battery life, and weigh hundreds of pounds. Even highly specialized narrow domain robots tend to max out at 8 hours with  several hundreds of pounds of cells onboard. (on wheels and flat ground no-less)

When are people going to realize this dude is blowing smoke up everyone's ass to inflate his garbage company's stock price.

Don't get me started on ""full self driving"". Without these vaporware promises, why is this stock valued so much more than Mercedes?

1. Missing earnings is priced in, if anything, stock was oversold. Some big hedge funds are actually buying in, and analyst price targets are higher than current prices
2. Tesla isn't just a car company. I am not pretending that it's a tech company per se, but it has other divisions, like battery that are profitable. Also, the FSD price cut will be instrumental going forward. I don't know of many car company that have convinced its buyers to pay $100 a month-$1200  a year per car on subscription.
3. Even though its being dragged, it still can pivot, and we know Musk-the guy who has convinced millions of people on his 'genius', isn't going to just admit defeat, and watch the stock go to shit, when he was just recently trying to get a 56 Billion payout

77,1gtutsd,2024-11-18 02:48:11,"Trump Team Eyes Rule Overhaul for Self-Driving Regulations, Potential Catalyst to Boost Tesla's Subscription Revenue","The Trump transition team is prioritizing the development of a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles, aiming to revise current regulations that limit the deployment of autonomous cars without human controls. This move aligns with the interests of Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO and a prominent Trump supporter, who is heavily invested in autonomous technology, including plans to launch driverless Tesla robotaxis by 2026.

Current regulations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) allow only 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under exemptions, creating barriers for Tesla and other manufacturers aiming for large-scale deployment. The Trump team is exploring leadership options for the Transportation Department, including former Uber executive Emil Michael, to craft policies that could facilitate mass adoption. Bipartisan legislative efforts to increase deployment caps and establish federal rules for autonomous vehicles have faced repeated setbacks, including challenges in Congress and failed compromises during the Biden administration.

Musk, who has been appointed alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead Trump’s ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" is advocating for streamlined regulations and has pledged to push for policies enabling nationwide use of autonomous vehicles. The initiative has raised concerns among rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft, whose stock prices dipped following Musk’s announcements.

The push reflects broader ambitions to dismantle regulatory hurdles and advance emerging technologies under the Trump administration, though significant legislative and bureaucratic challenges remain.

If he does, Tesla should go down, potentially erasing all of todays gains on the questionably bullish news. Regardless of how good Nvidia's earnings are, their presentation will likely be bad for Tesla since they will be talking about competing with Tesla. I think that in all cases, Tesla goes down after the Nvidia earnings presentation. The worst (best for puts) case scenario would be bad Nvidia earnings coupled with Huang doubling down on competing with Tesla on self driving and robots.

108,1c8v6o1,2024-04-20 17:17:26,"Elon Musk’s succession at Tesla, who might be next?","Hello everyone,
In the past months I have been collecting several articles around the subject in the title.

Elon Musk has always identified with Tesla, and Tesla has always been identified with Musk. But  given the train wreck performance of the business (not discussing here the share price, but just the real numbers and figures of the car business), it might be nice to discuss the topic here:

- Elon was the one deciding for 2.5 million production capacity, and so far its factories are being utilised at 60-70% capacity, with this number going down after the recent layoffs
- this huge production overcapacity forced the hand of the pricing strategy, and after cutting prices globally for more than 15 months, Q1-2024 was the first big quarter of negative growth. Q2-2024 will have negative growth too (bookmakers are much better than the market, for Q2-2024 they are at 392k vs 480k from Wall Street; last Q2 Tesla sold 466k!)
- prices have been lowered again in the 🇺🇸, confusing even the stronger supporters of Elon
- AI investments have been more words than facts, and many executives from the Tesla chip department left in the recent months https://electrek.co/2023/12/07/tesla-head-dojo-supercomputer-out-over-issues-next-gen/
- China is the big profit center of Tesla, and in the most recent layoffs they have been firing much more workers there. If China dies, Tesla profits simply evaporates (here a link to a Chinese news https://www.eet-china.com/mp/a307257.html where it is said that GigaShanghai will cut production by 30%, with the decision that is really affecting many suppliers in the area since Tesla is their largest customer; Aside from that, Tesla China also cutting personnel in many dept by 30-40%. All Tesla stores seeing cuts)

Zhu in November 2022
The first one talking about Musk succession was the board member of Tesla, James Murdoch, in November 2022. When the stock was spiralling down and the name of Zhou came out, please note he is the number Two at Tesla https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-china-boss-zhu-promoted-global-role-company-posting-2023-01-03/

Here a general article on who Zhu is https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/02/26/tesla-tom-zhu/

The CFO in May 2023
The name of the then CFO was made in May 2023 on a newspaper (WSJ) controlled by the family of James Murdoch https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-executive-elon-musk-cfo-zach-kirkhorn-b1998ae7

Both the times the stock recovered and nothing happened to Elon. But note that the CFO was fired/resigned in August 2023, replaced by the Chief of Accounting (that is a red flag)

Since then, Elon was accused twice by the WSJ (newspaper of Murdoch) of being a drug addict 
- January 2024 https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1
- February 2024 https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-tesla-money-drugs-board-61af9ac4 in this second one it is said that some Tesla BoD felt forced in consuming drugs with him/did not like this addiction of his, and resigned from the role for that reason

Of course Elon is a free man and he can do what he wants. But these two articles force us to ask several questions:
- why Elon/tesla did not sue the newspapers if the info were false?
- is then the drug addiction somehow related to the erratic pricing strategy and relentless sequence of extreme promises he has made so far ?
- what if some shareholders sue the BoD for lack of oversight asking to be refunded from their losses ? 
- does he really deserves a bonus if the BOD has never been independent ?

Several articles against Elon are questioning his leadership:
- Tesla chair under scrutiny for her oversight on Musk https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/teslas-board-elon-musk-robyn-denholm.html
- does Tesla have an Elon Musk problem? https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/hack/103671570
- ‘At what point do you decide Tesla is bigger than Musk?’ The time may be right for Elon Musk to step down as CEO, suggest experts

So, I wanted to bet on Tesla mooning as a result of Trump winning due to their new close relationship, and the deregulation that was coming for Tesla in the new administration. I'm not a political person, just trading off an idea!

So here's what I did:  
  
Bought $15,000 on 3:1 Kamala bets to win $30,000 to hedge my $50,000 in TSLA weekly calls. If she had won, I'd lose $10K-15K Max. If Trump won, this happens... Rolled my weekly calls to 29 Nov/ 20 Dec and held till today. Closed 95%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gouy6r/80000_to_112m_in_7_days_thank_you_elon_musk_tsla/

\*\*\*\*April 2nd Stats. There also seems to be a bit of confusion from a few of the comments. I am only up 18k as of now. Gain/Loss is equal to Total Profit/Loss on Schwab.\*\*\*\*

A few months ago I became convinced TSLA  was heading into the toilet not because of TSLA itself, but because I had been invested in the trainwreck dividend ETF TSLY. After my experience in TSLY, I knew TSLA   was doomed.

Since the beginning of March I have thrown everything I have into TSLA puts. There have definitely been some ass-clenching nervous moments where I have been tens of thousands of dollars in the red, such as Jpow's rate cut announcement and Elon's cringey price hike stunt.

But with the utterly horrid/wonderful Q1 delivery report, it seems I am finally seeing the light and my thesis that TSLA is an overvalued dogshit car company is finally being validated

I have dabbled  with covered calls and cash secured puts before, but this is actually my very first pure put play, and a very big boy one at that.

Looking for any any and all advice on how to proceed with this play.

Ideally I think Id hold until what will be a guaranteed earnings disaster and sell the day after, but I am worried about IV Crush, theta decay, etc.

Any thoughts, input, advice is welcome.

UPDATE: i sold Friday 4/5 for $30k profit. Essentially when the price was $164

A bit sad bc if i had sold at the floor of $160 i would have made $100k profit. 

But, I was thinking the price would go even lower and of course wasnt expecting Elons tweet pumps to raise the price up so quickly",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bu6i37/275k_yolo_tesla_puts/

What Musk predicted for Tesla, about their market cap higher than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined, it seems more likely to happen to Nvidia. 

Jensen in his capacity as CEO is not paid billions in salary, so not sure how he keeps himself motivated, constantly creating value for NVDA’s shareholders. He also owns less than 10% of Nvidia shares, and he is not worried of losing control of the company, and asking board for a big pay package. 

In my opinion, if anyone in the world deserves a US$50b pay package, it is Jensen.

The technology powered by Nvidia chips is going to be felt through many industries, across many countries.

The strategy was simple and regarded: Tesla had 3 green daily candles in a row leading up to Friday- which if you’ve been following Tesla’s dog water performance lately- is a huge anomaly so I figured Friday is leaning towards a red day.

1. Every single Tesla owner I know won’t lend out their cars. The lending out is the stupidest idea ever.  Every car owner I know won't lend out their car either.  Tesla will have to run their own fleet which will increase costs, maintenance etc.
2. Percentage of people willing to take a robotaxi daily are low; like Uber.  At best; it’s will be an Uber like service with limited use cases:  Traveling, airports, designated drivers etc.
3. Costs are astronomical when you add up all your small daily trips.  Two kids household in the US suburbs with limited public transportation.  I take approximately 8-10 roundtrips a day, sometimes more on the weekends.

For example: $7 per trip according to Musk: commute(2), kids school(2), kids activities(2-4), leisure or Starbucks or McDonald’s or family visits(2). $60-80 per day= $1500+ per month and that’s assuming every trip is $7.  Why not just own a car at    that price?

Edit: I forgot to add the emotional, pride and freedom of owning a car.  US consumers love their cars and trucks more so than guns.  A lot of people will die rather than give up their cars.

Edit: All the pro responses are parroting the same spiel that Musk, Woods and analysts are spewing.  No examples, no numbers, no market.  It's ""Believe me, it will happen"".  Same as the metaverse, Vision Pro, 3D printing, 3D TV which were all touted as the next big thing but ended being a limited market.

Their car and energy businesses will be fine but the trillions robotaxi business has always been a fantasy.   This ain’t about the stock price or where it’s going.

163,1g188s3,2024-10-11 12:09:14,TESLA CYBERCAB VS WAYMO : AN ANALYSIS ,"For all the regards who don't know, Waymo is the market leader in true autonomous vehicles right now. They have been operating a fleet of robo taxis (fully autonomous cars) in multiple cities for a while now. 

So I did a short comparison and analysis. 



KEY POINTS FROM ""WE, ROBOT"" EVENT:



1. The robotaxi is a purpose-built autonomous vehicle, lacking a steering wheel or pedals, meaning it will need approval from regulators before going into production.

.
.

2. Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab production by 2026 — although he said it could be as late as 2027. 

.
.

3. Tesla is developing the Optimus robot, which could be available for $20,000-$30,000, and is capable of performing various tasks.


.
.

4. Cybercab was revealed the prototype robotaxi at Tesla's ""We, Robot” event held at the Warner Bros. film lot in Burbank, California, with a lot of non-public roads for the demonstration. 


.
.

5. Tesla has reportedly been mapping the area in advance of the demonstration, even though the company says it doesn't rely on high-definition maps to power its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist feature


.
.
.


TESLA VS WAYMO : KEY DIFFERENCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND APPROACH 



.
.

1. Sensing the World:

 -  - Waymo's Multi-Sensor Fusion:  Waymo uses a suite of sensors that work together. This is like having multiple senses.


I. Lidar:  Acts like super-precise radar, creating a 3D ""point cloud"" of the surroundings. This excels in low-light and complex environments.

II. Radar: Detects objects and their speed, even in rain or fog.
   

III. Cameras: Provide visual information for recognizing objects like traffic lights and pedestrians.




- - Tesla's Vision-Only System: Tesla relies heavily on cameras, believing that they can provide enough data for AI to understand the world like humans do.


I. Neural Networks:  Tesla uses powerful AI to process the visual data from cameras.


II. No Lidar:  Tesla famously excludes lidar, arguing it's expensive and unnecessary.


- Why this matters:  Lidar provides highly accurate depth and distance data, which is crucial for navigating complex situations. Tesla's vision-only approach is more ambitious but may struggle in conditions where cameras are less effective (e.g., heavy rain, fog).



.
.


2. Understanding the Environment:

I. Waymo's HD Maps: Waymo creates incredibly detailed 3D maps of the areas where its vehicles operate. These maps include road geometry, lane markings, traffic signs, and even the positions of trees and buildings.


II.  Localization: This allows Waymo's cars to precisely locate themselves within the map, even in challenging conditions.


III. Predictability:  Maps help anticipate what's coming and plan routes accordingly.


IV.  Tesla's Real-Time Learning: Tesla relies less on pre-mapped environments. Its AI learns to interpret the world in real-time, based on the data it gathers from its cameras.


V. Generalization: The goal is to create a system that can drive anywhere, not just in pre-mapped areas.


VI. Adaptability: Tesla's system can potentially adapt to new environments and situations more quickly.



- - Why this matters: Waymo's HD maps provide a high level of certainty in known areas, but mapping is expensive and time-consuming. Tesla's approach is more scalable but relies heavily on the AI's ability to correctly interpret complex scenes.



.
.
.

3. Deployment Strategies:

I. Waymo's Gradual Rollout: Waymo has focused on deploying its robotaxi service in specific cities, starting with Phoenix. This allows for careful testing and refinement in controlled environments.


II.  Safety First:  Waymo prioritizes safety and has a strong track record.

III.  Controlled Expansion:  They expand their service area gradually as they gain confidence in their technology.



 IV.  Tesla's Beta Testing: Tesla has released its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to a wider group of drivers. This allows them to gather vast amounts of real-world driving data.


V.  Rapid Iteration:  Tesla can quickly improve its system through frequent software updates.


 VI. Driver Responsibility:  FSD is still a driver-assist system, and drivers are expected to remain vigilant and take over when necessary.


- -  Why this matters: Waymo's approach is more cautious, prioritizing safety and controlled testing. Tesla's approach is faster and more agile, but it also carries more risk, as evidenced by accidents involving FSD.



These are some of the core differences between Waymo and Tesla's approach to self-driving. Both companies are pushing the boundaries of technology, but their philosophies and strategies are quite distinct. It will be fascinating to see how these approaches evolve in the years to come.

EDIT:  THE MUSK PARADOX 


The entire Tesla brand is highly dependent on Elon. Essentially Elon is Tesla. A lot of the Tesla Brand value is tied up with Elon Musk the human.

This wasn't a problem in the past when Elon seemed like a nerd who just loved tech and posted memes.

Fast forward to 2024, the guy is full blow republican (not saying it's bad or good). He is actively involved with politics.

IMO, He's too busy ""owning the libs"" and fighting cultural wars (""woke virus""). 

Now combine this with his other behavioral problems like self administration of ketamine and using other drugs, and we have a recipe for disaster.


FYI, I'm not an Elon Hater. I used to admire him and it's sad to watch his downfall.


. . . . .


. . . . .

TLDR;


IMO, the event was Very Disappointing. 

Elon announced (NOT ACTUALLY LAUNCHED) basically what he has been promising for years (TRUE AUTONOMY AKA FSD).

It was no different than the previous announcements of FSD and Cybertruk.

I expect delays (regulatory approvals and the actual tech being ready).


. . . . .



. . . . . 


UPDATE :

. . . . . 

For all the regards who don't understand what WAYMO actually is, I just did another post analyzing Google (the owner of Waymo) and why they're the number 1 player in AI, robotics and self driving.

170,1c65j7b,2024-04-17 09:30:40,"Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative","Hello everyone,

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sconsk9a80vc1.jpg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5c2900ac71c3a215c70f0722e3047c204b3ace6

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

But let’s crack down on the bear party just for a second and use *logical* reasoning for why TSLA might not end up in the gutter as many would think. 

1. Expectations are low, just like Q1 (will get back to this later).
2. Their shittiness is priced in already after Robotaxi event.
3. Elon Musk is a master stock manipulator. 

Keeping all of this in mind, this isn’t even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk’s Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports. 

On the day of Tesla’s Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks. 

On the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn’t tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%. 

Seems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he’s in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall. 

Now guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today? 

*15 fucking times*. 

You heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That’s triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn’t, and he’s letting us know right below our own nose! 

All of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I’m betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk’s tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late. 

This is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you. 

Positions: 15 minutes before market close, I’ll buy 3 217.5C exp. OCT. 25th.

178,1fqy99e,2024-09-27 21:11:23,Tesla more like Deadsla,"Hello fellow regards and thank you for coming to my Tesla talk. Today I am going to explain the bear case for TSLA in the short term

1. I’m not a super technical trader/indicator freak, but TSLA is currently near or above overbought territory on every RSI timeframe, including 1mo, 3mo, 1y, and 5y. This can be explained by the hype surrounding delivery numbers, upcoming robotaxi event, and earnings. RSI is not the end all be all for a stock’s price but it’s good to note

2. TSLA has been on a tear recently as investors are pricing in good delivery numbers, a successful robotaxi announcement, and good earnings. All it takes is ONE of these events to go poorly and investors will panic

3. ROBOTAXI EVENT - this will probably be the biggest influence in the stock price for the short term, and I don’t think it will go well. Apart from Tesla’s history of screwing up announcements (see 6% drop after cybertruck fail), I simply don’t think Tesla has the technology to compete with Waymo, the main competitor for this type of product. Waymo is backed by google, a HUGE cloud storage provider. This means they’re able to train their models with more data, more TPU infrastructure, and a better AI team. Tesla, on the other hand, uses a vision-only model that requires a MASSIVE amount of data to be stored in places they don’t have. This is shown in their latest FSD versions, which experience about 180 miles per critical error. For reference, human drivers experience about 100,000 miles per critical error and Waymo is at 17,000. Unless Tesla is prepared to unleash some magical new tech stack that they’ve been hiding for some reason, I don’t think they have the tech to release a safe robotaxi to compete with Google. Safety is huge in the driverless car space, because most consumers are already on the fence about being a passenger in one. One misstep in the rollout and TSLA bears would have a field day. I also think that Elon is too full of himself to admit some of these things, so he would happily march out a product that isn’t ready for the public to use rather than acknowledge Tesla’s FSD shortcomings

4. Future events - the nice thing about delivery numbers, robotaxi event, and earnings being in a span of a few weeks is that IV shouldn’t be a huge factor until after everything is all said and done, and you could probably make money buying puts OR calls before the robotaxi event and simply selling the volatility. 

Obviously nobody can predict how earnings will go, but I think one of the main reasons investors give for Tesla’s ridiculous PE is its market share, advanced technology, and production ability in the EV space. While I still think it has some upside for those reasons, I think other EV companies are chipping away at all 3. You can go on google right now and find open source code that performs nearly as well as Tesla’s FSD and vision models.

TL;DR - I think there is more downside opportunity than upside with Tesla, and I think bad performance in upcoming numbers and events will tank the stock that has risen 25% in the last month

What will be the final straw that causes you to sell the stock? The fundamentals of the company are degrading, yet the stock price isn't really going down that much. This means that people aren't really selling. The stock trades at a forward PE of about 60, probably higher if current estimates are too high, which they likely are. The growth of the company is stalling and the company is desperately trying to drop prices and do all sorts of other things to sell cars. Elon is a loose canon and while in the past that was a good thing, it now seems like more of a liability than at anything. The stock trades at a rich valuation because people expect a bright future ahead, but what will cause you to change your mind about Tesla's future and sell the stock? Elon has promised quite a lot and you probably believe him, but he has a bad record of overpromising, so what, if anything, will cause you stop believing in what he says?

I feel obligated to post this after reading through a few threads and being shocked at the misinformation in this sub.

I believe Tesla is at the cusp of solving autonomous driving. I'll go over some of the points that people are not considering/misunderstanding in the following text.

""They've been doing this for years and it's still nothing more than advanced cruise control."" This misses a huge detail. FSD V12 is fundamentally a different architecture from all previous versions. V11 had 300k + C programming, V12 has removed all of this, shifting the approach to an end-to-end solution. This has always been the endpoint; end-to-end is scalable and easily trained, it learns by itself instead of being programmed by limited humans. Tesla is one of the biggest customers of NVIDIA's GPUs, Elon Musk tweeted a month ago (see image attached) that compute is no longer a bottleneck. You could claim Elon is just lying but the proof is in the pudding. FSD V12 has been having a steady and fast update release schedule. We are now in V12.3.4 after several updates. The fact that the software shifted to fully self-learning AI means now you just need two things: data (good diversity, non-simulated, and proprietary data) and compute. Compute doesn't seem to be a current bottleneck so let's see how the data is looking.

Take a look at the image attached showing miles driven while using FSD. Data that falls under this category is important as interventions are one of the most important data types; it allows you to see the difference between what the software would've done and where the human disagrees. It's straightforward to see why this is invaluable. As you can see, this graph represents an obvious exponential growth, and it isn't slowing down in the upcoming months. Half the eligible fleet (US and Canada) still hasn't got/downloaded the free month trial. Subscription cost just lowered to $99 a month from $200. People on Twitter are overwhelmingly impressed and shocked at the quality. Whoever has the software, I ask you to give it a test drive again if you weren't impressed at first and you'll be shocked.

This amount of data coupled with the compute Tesla has, gives the company a SIGNIFICANT advantage in the pursuit of creating a generalized driving solution that is scalable. Tesla has 6 million+ vehicles collecting millions of frames of data a day. No one else has this much access to real-world relevant data, no one. Rivalling Tesla on compute is also extremely expensive, and without the data to train it, it makes no financial sense.

Don't sleep on Tesla, I've never seen such a mismatch of sentiment vs technology in my life.

First off I live in Austin and I drive by the plant every once in a while. They have cars stacked 4 and 5 high, looks like almost a 1,000 if not more. Cybertrucks too. They have finally caught up to demand and now have way too much supply. The CyberTruck is a dud. I canceled my order, so did everyone else I know. The Model Y and 3 seem to sell well but I rarely see a new model X or Y. So the high end has stopped moving. Plus they have lowered the prices so much they have destroyed the high margins they were making. Plaid has gone from almost $140k to less than $100k. That’s a lot of profit gone. Tesla dealerships have them stored to the Moon. Same thing cars stacked 4 and 5 high and parked all over the place. At other Dealerships I am being told by friends who live in other parts of the Country that it’s worse. 

The entire car industry is having massive issues but Ford and GM are not valued at 60xs forward earnings. 

I think Elon is going to try to preempt the Earnings disaster with his “RoboTaxi” announcement on the 10th. 1 week before earnings on the 16th. Try to ride the “AI” hype. 

Power-walls don’t sell, Solar does not pencil out, and they are not building a robot anytime soon.

But they still can’t make my dam Roadster, been on order for 4 years plus. 

Me thinking of taking out a nice Put position for the 16th. Short term Puts will be cheap and stock has rallied back over $250. Perfect timing to knock $50 bucks off the stock. 

That’s what happened last time.

**I Believe in the MUSK**

 

I think Tesla is a highly undervalued play right now, especially in the AI sector.

 

**Anecdotal Evidence**

 

I’m starting with my own experience of traveling the world and seeing Teslas everywhere. I’ve been to over 30 states and noticed their prevalence in each one. Beyond the U.S., I’ve spotted Teslas in countries like Greece, Albania, the Philippines, Korea, and Germany. Even in some of the most remote parts of these countries, Teslas are present. To me, this shows the strength of the brand. Globally, people recognize Tesla as a leading car company, appreciating both its designs and the values it stands for.

 

**Elon Hate**

 

Alongside this, there’s the fact that Elon Musk—loved and hated by many—is the face of the company. Whether you like him or not, you can’t deny that he’s extremely well-known. And as they say, “no press is bad press.” Everyone knows Musk and the cars he represents. Some may argue that his polarizing nature could harm Tesla, but I believe that people ultimately buy good vehicles, and their feelings about the CEO won’t stop Tesla’s success. Look at other tech leaders like Mark Zuckerberg or Tim Cook, who have faced severe public backlash, yet their companies have continued to grow. Public opinion can change; Zuckerberg, for example, is now seen sporting gold chains and Yeezy clothing. I believe something similar will happen with Musk. Eventually, the dislike for him will either fade or turn into admiration. Don’t you want to be part of the Musky baby babe?

 

**2035 EV Mandates**

 

Currently, 13 states have EV mandates for 2035 or earlier, and 45 states offer EV incentives. This means that people will have to switch to electric vehicles whether they like it or not. In these states alone, the population exceeds 60 million—that’s already 18% of our entire country set to go EV within the next decade, and this number will only grow as more states pass similar laws. Personally, I think people should choose EVs because they’re a superior platform to ICE vehicles, not just because of mandates. Having visited several of these states, I can’t stress enough how many Teslas I see on the road—you can’t drive for long without spotting one. They’re everywhere.

 

**Self-Driving**

 

We all know Elon has repeatedly promised that self-driving technology would already be here, and I agree it’s frustrating. No one really knows when it will arrive. However, no other company is operating at Tesla’s level, and it’s only a matter of time until they solve the self-driving puzzle. Tesla has over 5 million vehicles constantly running and recording data, with that number only growing. No other automaker is collecting this amount of real-time, global data. Watch current videos of Tesla’s latest FSD (Full Self-Driving) version—you’ll be amazed at how close we are to success. A good YouTube channel to check out is AIDRIVR.

 

**RoboTaxi and Robo-Semi**

 

Once self-driving is perfected, RoboTaxi and Robo-Semi trucks will revolutionize the industry. We already know that ride-hailing is a massive business with high demand. RoboTaxis will be able to undercut the cost of human drivers so significantly that most people will choose them 9 out of 10 times. Plus, a new segment of the market will emerge—people who start ride-hailing because of the reduced cost. We’ve seen the success of companies like Waymo, which has a strong fanbase and continues to grow. Once Tesla nails self-driving and offers a superior service worldwide, it’s poised to dominate. The same goes for semi-trucks—companies will be eager to get their hands on them to comply with 2035 EV mandates, earn tax credits, and reduce costs by eliminating the need for human drivers and all associated expenses. Imagine a world where Optimus robots load a Tesla semi, which then drives itself across the country and is unloaded at another store—completely automated. I don’t think we’re too far off from that reality.

 

**Charging Infrastructure**

 

Tesla has over 50,000 chargers worldwide, many of which are Superchargers. No other car company has this level of infrastructure and support. This is huge—other companies, like Rivian, are already signing deals with Tesla to use their chargers. Companies will be forced to stay competitive in the EV market. Consumers want to drive long distances; the U.S., for example, is built on the highway system. People don’t want to feel limited by their EVs, stuck within city limits, or forced to wait hours for their cars to charge. As people gradually switch to EVs, they’ll demand the support that only Tesla can currently provide.

 

**Optimus**

Optimus is still in its early stages, but it signals that Tesla has completed the consumer car phase of its business. Now, they just need to keep producing the S, 3, X, Y models, and the Cybertruck, making them more affordable. With that under control, Tesla has the bandwidth to focus on new ventures—where the real gains lie. Tesla can leverage the real-world AI they’ve been training on driving data and apply it to Optimus. Every company is looking to reduce human labor and automate more tasks. Whether you like it or not, this shift is happening, and it’s wise to get on board by owning some stock. Fast food, for example, has been gradually reducing human interaction with touch screens—many people now rarely interact with a person. With advancements in AI, robots like Optimus will become a part of our daily lives, running factories and handling repetitive tasks. While this will impact the job market in the short term, people will need to adapt and learn new skills, just like with any major societal shift. I don’t see widespread adoption happening anytime soon. I predict that by 2030, Optimus will be working in factories, but day-to-day use is likely at least a decade away. Still, in the long term, I believe it’s inevitable.  Imagine a world where Optimus is your wife's bf and you can spend all day gambling on stocks as he takes care of her.

EDIT\*\*

forgot to add this cus im regarded

**Energy Sector**

  
Tesla's energy sector more than doubled its profits since the last quarter, it will continue to grow and eventually outpace the automotive sector. Many people think Teslas is just an automotive company not realizing it's only one piece of the pie and will continue to play less and less into the company's profits. Tesla will eventually be regarded as a name like Apple with many sectors encapsulated under the name. Self Driving, Robots, Energy, etc.

2. The electric vehicle industry as a whole is becoming more **crowded** than ever before at the absolute **worst time** for the company, just as its fundamentals are coming into question. To date the company's share price has dropped more than **60%** from its 2021 all-time high of $407.
3. This cramped competition can be realized even further with the fact that China’s electric vehicle champion, BYD, has **overtaken** Tesla as the **largest** EV producer in the world, with a 22% increase in global sales for Q4 of last year, surpassing Tesla by over 41,000 units. This is bad news for Tesla as it begins to lose its **foothold** over the Asian region even further as its ***gap*** over the Chinese rival decreased from 400,000 units posted in 2022 to 230,000 units posted in 2023.
4. After **missing** expectations on the company's reported earnings earlier this year, it has become apparent that demand for electric vehicles has **declined** and is notably lower than last year. The company seems to be **stuck** between two major growth phases as it works on launching its next-generation vehicles. We can only hope that those new cars don’t have any major issues as the current generation of vehicles does; otherwise, Tesla could spiral into an even deeper rabbit hole than it currently is.

Despite this month's insane rally, I think Tesla is undervalued due to their insurmountable lead in real-world data collection for Full-Self Driving (FSD) training.

Their only competitor is Waymo, but Waymo's advantages are limited and can be easily copied by Tesla. Here is Waymo's approach to self-driving:

* Taxis are limited to geo-fenced regions with high-resolution maps
* If the taxi is stuck, a human driver will remotely take over with no indication to the passenger.
* Dependent on very expensive sensors (i.e. lidar and radar)

Comparison of Fleet Size and Mileage:

* Tesla fleet: 4,000,000  -- Waymo: 600
* Miles driven: Tesla: >1.3 Billion -- Waymo: ~10-20 million

Waymo does 50,000 paid trips per week in cities, but the growth potential of their AI is limited due to the relatively small, homogeneous training set. In my opinion, their main accomplishment is the illusion of proficiency created by these ""silent"" human interventions.

When Tesla releases their robotaxi, they will be able to adopt all of Waymo's advantages, even the silent takeovers. Couple this with their insurmountable lead in training data (Over 1 billion hours of FSD data in all driving conditions/environments), and I think they will rapidly outshine Waymo.

In particular, I think the impact of the silent human takeovers cannot be overstated.  Tesla could easily adopt this and achieve essentially perfect self-driving overnight.  It will impress the general public and make the share price go up.

I am eager to hear what you fucking idiots think.

For some background, I have used FSD daily for the last year and am massively impressed by its rate of improvement.  I bought the call option after I realized that most of the public thinks FSD is a fraud, impossible, or uninteresting.

I am already at 460% return but I intend to hold until expiration.

228,1foeafq,2024-09-24 14:47:25,"RIVN vs. TSLA - Rivian Target - $45+, Tesla ? ","Rivian has a market value currently around 12B –  right under 12/sh, and could easily double from here and further be worth $45+ over the next couple years as deliveries increase – it's an early Tesla play, with growing momentum in their production and excitement for their pipeline. 

It trades at a fraction of the valuation metrics Tesla does in every sense, but Rivian has an exciting pipeline coming and is the shiny new product non-EV and EV owners alike are excited for. 

Compared to Tesla’s delays and pushing off robots and everything else, Rivian is actively growing and has a great pipeline over the next 2 years.   
   
**Bear case** –  

Rivian is burning too much money, and losing on every vehicle sold, and will ***FAIL*** –  

Burning money is not sustainable, and I agree. *But will it actually fail*?   
   
They are still early in ramp with higher production costs, but building more of a car than Tesla offers and working with less subsidies than Tesla originally had. Yet, they have key production growth, and are prepped for the acceleration of their product demand with both commercial vehicles and consumer vehicles.  

**Factory Upgrades and Focus on Margin**

Rivian has guided towards seeing better margins this fall, in part from the re-tooling seen this last May. [Normal Site Retooling](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/rivian-completes-plant-retooling-pivotal-to-profitability/715673/) 

They are continuing to invest in their site, with approved plans to build out a larger space and prepare for R2 production, both of these upgrades leading to over 215,000 units of capacity across the R1 / R2 / Commercial platforms they offer. [R2 Site Expansion](https://electrek.co/2024/08/20/rivian-rivn-approved-major-plant-expansion-r2/#:~:text=Rivian%20gets%20the%20green%20light%20for%20massive%20plant%20expansion&text=The%20amendments%20to%20its%20site,ft%2C%20or%20roughly%205%25) 

Further, the VW Partnership further mentioned below has already brought tailwinds and initial cost savings, and will likely further support long term profitability. [VW Partnership Cost Savings](https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/rivian-supplier-cost-savings-vw-partnership-earnings-q2/723660/)

**Production Analysis** 

Recently in another group, a user posted their production analysis, and it’s following Tesla’s quite well: [Rivian vs. Tesla Production Ramp](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1f2yk9y/comparing_rivian_and_teslas_production_ramp/?share_id=67dj9Qr_8DjKXpFglZzfQ&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) 

While Rivian is still early, they’ve already shown what the R2 ([R2 / R3 walkthrough with RJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0Gt_PUyldc) ) and R3 - ([R3 Design walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoBBibT_IAI)) -  will look like, and people are EXCITED for them to come out in 2026 (R3X potentially fall '26 or later).  

While we see headwinds in the EV industry, as time goes on EV infrastructure will continue to increase, furthering EV adoption (including Rivian).  It doesn't seem like Tesla will be the only pure-play EV company to survive.

So who is buying Rivians currently?  

Tesla owners, among others. More Rivians are being sold, and they are starting to be a choice among Subaru owners (a sticky owner usually), Tesla owners trading up, and even first time EV owners. Plenty of people from EVs to ICE vehicles are trading up and into Rivians, and are loving them!  

It makes sense the love for Rivian current owners have – it is a beautifully designed vehicle around the user, made with intelligent features people love to use from adventuring to everyday driving. 

Importantly, it’s also built around the technological architecture of the vehicle. Instead of other vehicles with 100 different computers that don’t talk well with each other, Rivian is building each platform as a tech-first platform, which is why VW – who has struggled with their own software and advancing tech internally – has partnered with Rivian, to the tune of $5 Billion when the company was worth $10 Billion.   
   
VW still has $4B more to invest in Rivian, so adding that to the $8B in cash they had as of their last earnings report, and Rivian is worth more today and long term. 

**Partnerships** 

Rivian has some large backing, between the Amazon contract they are producing for, and the VW Rivian Partnership. VW is a large player with many brands like Porsche, VW, Audi, and more – but they’ve struggled trying to build better tech internally. For a group seeing headwinds in the industry and China, partnering with Rivian isn’t a risk they would take if they didn’t need to – while the partnership is important for Rivian, it’s incredibly important for VW as well, including the level of due diligence needed for a $5B investment in Rivian. ([VW Struggles with Software](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2024/07/11/volkswagen-rivian-joint-venture)) Notably, while we talk about Rivian vehicle production and ramp, it's Rivian's tech-first focus and the way they've built a vehicle around the technology which also differentiates them and attracts VW to this deal.

Additionally, while Rivian continues to produce and deliver vans for Amazon, they are now also able to sell similar vans to other companies. While Amazon was the first, this adds to the moat Rivian is working to develop that defends their positioning – commercial EV sale -.[Rivian Commercial Vans](https://rivian.com/fleet). As the demand for last-mile delivery grows, Rivian is well positioned to take market share in the commercial space as well as consumer space. 

**Team** 

While Tesla has a crazy cult following, combined with Elon Musk’s cult following, RJ is similarly an engineer at heart but is a down to earth guy that also has a PH.D. from MIT. His exec team has experience across the auto landscape, having experience previously at Tesla, Chrysler, Volvo, Stellantis, and Jeep, as well as Apple, JPM, and more. His team is experienced across different facets of the industry, and brings both a tech focus with auto experience into Rivian's design, production, and overall customer focus.

**Summary**

EVs have plenty of headwinds, but considering how much existing customers love the product, the excitement for what is coming for the brand, the cash on hand and backing from VW, the commercial vehicle side, and overall positioning, I think the risk is worth the significant upside Rivian is positioned for.

Let me make it clear to you regards on how Mercedes level 3( drive pilot) is a joke & why Tesla will be big winner in this category. Let’s go over each category here

Mercedes level 3 autonomy is what they call drive pilot & we all know Tesla level 2 autonomy is fsd.

Here’s the big differences between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot 

1)Mercedes drive pilot can only operate in highways whereas Tesla fsd will work on both highways & city streets

2) The speed limit on Mercedes drive pilot is 40mph max whereas Tesla fsd is 85mph, here Mercedes drive pilot needs to follow other vehicles whereas in Tesla case it is not required to follow other vehicles.

3) Regarding the traffic patterns Mercedes is not capable of handling interchange whereas Tesla fsd is capable of most of the traffic patterns

4) Mercedes drive pilot doesn’t work with flashing lights in the area, meanwhile Tesla fsd functions with flashing lights 

5) Mercedes drive pilot doesn’t work in construction zones, Tesla fsd operates in the construction zones

6) Mercedes drive pilot usage in day time only whereas Tesla fsd can work in daytime or nighttime use

7) Mercedes drive pilot cannot change lanes whereas Tesla fsd can change lanes 

8) Mercedes drive pilot needs the lane lines whereas for Tesla fsd lane lines is not required 

9) Mercedes drive pilot is functioning only in California & Nevada whereas Tesla fsd in all 50 states, Tesla in the last 24hr Tesla has launched subscriptions for Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) in China, as many expect that the company could soon launch its Full Self-Driving (FSD) in the country

So if you look above the staggering difference between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot, Tesla is making a steady progress & will be big winner in this category. 

Now before you tesla haters, 🐻 open your mouth on how Tesla fsd is still level 2 autonomy & is inferior to Mercedes drive pilot, remember to do some research. Tesla hate on wsb is getting real & constant fudge on how Tesla will fail is laughable 

They won’t go bankrupt, yes they had a shitty quarter but holding 27 billion cash. If tesla can’t make it no other evs. Atleast Tesla is making money on every car they sell whereas wsb darling rivian is losing 40k for every car they sell.

271,1dcthx9,2024-06-10 19:00:58,Musk Pay Package is a lose/lose for TSLA,"I believe the upcoming TSLA shareholder's meeting could be a lose/lose for the company.  At issue: whether shareholders believe Musk should receive his $56B pay package (originally agreed in 2018 and struck down by a Delaware judge earlier this year).  Proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against approving the package, and many institutional investors have followed their lead.  Still, a majority (56%) of those [surveyed](https://www.teslarati.com/morgan-stanley-survey-tesla-investors-will-ratify-elon-musk-2018-comp-plan/) said they expect the proposal to be approved.

However, whichever way this vote goes, I expect a negative outcome for TSLA.  There's one of two outcomes:

**A) Musk Pay Approved**

* If the pay package is approved, it would bring Musk's ownership of the company close to 25% and dillute all other shareholders by 10%.
* For many shareholders I expect this to be the last straw for them.  Those who vote against the package will see this as musk trying to extract as much value as he can from a dying company.  Especially after this year's sales slowdown (Hertz is [selling](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/06/ev-sales-slump-hertz-dump-take-used-tesla-to-no-haggle-25000-price.html) off its Tesla fleet, admitting the move was a mistake) and axing of the entire supercharger team.  Not to mention Musk's continued shitposting [alienating](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/elon-musk-turned-democrats-off-tesla-when-he-needed-them-most-176023af) desperately needed democrat buyers.

**B) Musk Pay Denied**

* If the pay package is denied, I think it would indicate the beginning of the end for Tesla.  Musk has already said that he would shift his focus to his other companies if he doesn't get his $56B.
* He has threatened to develop AI at one of his other companies instead, and has already admitted to diverting Nvidia GPUs from Tesla to xAI and Twitter.
* Musk has been the primary driving force behind Tesla, and without his presence and constant hype I think his diehard supporters will begin to reevaluate their ownership of Tesla stock, leading to a major selloff.

274,1beo0cg,2024-03-14 15:34:37,It's time to buy $TSLA ($165). My bull case.,"Current Price: $165.  

I'm a value investor, but TSLA has finally reached a price today ($165) I consider a steal.  Everyone should have at least 1-5% of their portfolio in TSLA at these prices.   No doubt the stock has short term problems.  From slowing China sales, to Hertz dropping it, to slowdown in German production.  And that is already reflected in the price. In 6 months, it’s dropped almost in half from $299 to $165.  But there are some major long term points the market is missing:

Robotaxis.  

I believe there is at least a 50% probability that Tesla has an Nvidia-like moment w/in the next ten years when the first Tesla robotaxis hit the streets. Imagine Tesla makes a car for $20K.  That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself).  That car could easily generate $50K annually.  That’s a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.  

They made 1.85M cars in 2023.  Up 38% YOY.  If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years.  Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year.  That's $375M+ in revenue.  It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue.  That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. 

Other EV Pain is Tesla’s Gain.

Tesla dropped prices largely because they can, unlike the other EV makers. The legacy autos (ie Ford, GM) and even new rivals (ie Rivian) don’t have any margins on EVs yet.  They actually lose money by making them. So the competition is getting frustrated and giving up. That’s making people believe the whole industry is hurt.  But that pain is actually gain for Tesla, in the form of future market share. And it shows just how high a mountain they already climbed.  Nobody else can figure out how to make EVs profitably.  Tesla is one of the best run companies in the world and that’s how they accomplished it. They have some of the best engineers and maintain a very lean operation.  

Fair Value

If you believe that in the next ten years Tesla will be a trillion dollar company, you should buy at these prices.   If we discount at a 5.5% rate, 1,000,000,000 / 1.055^10 = $585M, which would correlate to a Tesla stock price of $184.19 (because there are 3.176M shares outstanding).  I personally believe that Tesla is going to be a $2T or even $3T company.  Discounting the previously mentioned $1.875T market cap would land at a current price of $345.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1beo0cg/its_time_to_buy_tsla_165_my_bull_case/

Here’s what they're expecting:

* Earnings per share: 62 cents expected

* Revenue: $24.77 billion expected

Just for comparison:  A year ago, Tesla reported 91 cents of EPS and sales of $24.9 billion. First and formost, I'm getting a put spread. Not puts. IV is just way too high for just puts. Spreads reduce the IV and focuses more on the underlying. But why puts? The stock actually PUMPED hard last earnings. Well, let me explain. 

Lower sales volume and vehicle prices are behind the expected decline. Tesla delivered about 444,000 vehicles in the second quarter at an average realized price of $42,500. A year ago, the company shipped about 466,000 vehicles at an average price of about $44,000.

There's really no indicators telling me that they're doing better as a constant decline in sales will probably continue well into 2025. Just look at the headlines. Musk's cybertruck is a complete failure. The tesla semi is a dud. The tesla roaster isn't out and will never be out. And his other projects? Hyperloop, solar panel shingles? All busts. 

Yea I'm expecting a >10% drop today. TSLA 7/26 240p is just a bit too expensive for an earning play, so this is why I'm getting the spread. Buying the 240p while selling the 225p (same exp) seems like a smart choice to me. I can grab the spread for 477 bucks right now at the time of writing. Meaning, if TSLA drops as much as I expect today, this spread should profit over 3x. Good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eaf4yn/why_im_playing_tsla_puts_today/

As you can guess this strategy has not worked well this month and my YTD profit from my favorite EV company is now down to $40k (see second pic)

Margins keep getting tighter and tighter, falling to levels similar to other automotive companies. “But but FSD and robotaxi”. FSD hasn’t had the perceived success they thought it would have - people just like driving their cars and the extra value isn’t there for the normal person. Robotaxi won’t be ready this year, I’d be surprised if it’s ready next year - this is the most obvious sell the news out there, especially based on Tesla’s track record of over-promising and hyping things up. 


They currently have nothing in their financials but “hope” that signals a turnaround. Fundamentals clearly show TSLA is overpriced and I expect a tank in the near term. Oh and once the Delaware judge validates the attorney fees Tesla will have to pay those attorneys in billions worth of options which will almost assuredly be sold.

2. Leadership. Musk has spread himself too thinly. Spends his days tweeting random conspiracies, aside from running idk how many side companies. Seems he has shiny object syndrome and clearly the attention isn’t on Tesla right now.

3. Competition. Chinese EVs are better. Cheaper. He said it himself. Americans will eventually catch on and shift to those. 

4. Regulations. Trump gets elected, he will favor fuel/hybrids. He could’ve made Biden-Harris his allies as they clearly care more about climate change, EV stuff - but he’s alienated them more than ever. 

He’s also alienated his core customer base (climate conscious left-wing folks, right wing folks mostly think EVs are gay)

His lack of content moderation and refusal to cooperate with the world’s largest govs can cost him big. See Pavel Durov’s current situation. 

6. Stock price. Tesla is overbought. Has been for a while. Was fine when it was seen as the highest growth EV contender, but its subsiding with competition. He’s been pushing for it to be valued as an AI company but it’s not happening. The $56bn payout that was just approved shows he probably thought that money was more productive out the company versus reinvested.

7. X is bleeding cash. He’ll probably sell some $TSLA stock to reinject money into it since he’s not letting it go bankrupt and most likely won’t sell it either.

Based on the above. I call a top.

290,1cb3pqq,2024-04-23 12:46:19,TSLA: Big question for Elon today on earnings day!,"IMO, the biggest question for Elon to answer during today’s earnings will be what is Tesla strategy to counter $20K BYD Chinese cars coming into US soon from Mexican factories?

BYD executives announced on Wednesday the automaker will begin selling its Dolphin Mini electric vehicle (EV) in Mexico at 358,800 pesos ($20,990). 

If Elon’s plan to compete with BYD is to ask the president to put 100% tariffs on BYD imports, that’s not a good working plan. As I understand, there’s a limit to tariffs and then it goes to WTO for arbitration. Another problem is China can retaliate with its own sanctions & tariffs!

I have been saying for a long time now, Tesla needs a CEO who can focus on the car, customers & shareholders instead of X, fighting with media and its main customers - the liberals who have almost completely abandoned Tesla. IMO, the way things are going Tesla may go down below $125 soon. Long term, I’m still optimistic on Tesla, unfortunately it has become one manchild dependent company with a spineless board.

292,1hr783s,2025-01-01 17:11:17,Gains are not worth the risk,"I wrote this in the hopes of saving some of you future heartache and irreversible trauma. I lost 110k over the past month. The majority after options calls during the bloodbath after december fed meeting. 
 
If i could go back to my past self, i would say this. The loss isn't worth the potential gains. Before, I was just burnt out from my job. But at least i was proud to have saved up my first 100k. Now im burnt out, down 3 years of savings, and have a lot less freedom in my life.  I can't focus on work, i'm depressed and can't find joy in my hobbies anymore. I'm probably in the process of ruining my relationship as well. Even if i had won, i definitely don't think I'd be happier an equivalent amount. 

Life is hard. If you worked hard and earned some money. Dont make degenerate bets. The vast majority of us are just normal humans who should just save their time and invest in part index fund and part cash equivalents.

Or maybe this marks the bottom and it is a buying opportunity. Your choice. 

EDIT
Was only expecting maybe max 100 upvotes but i guess I said something that resonates. 

After wading through the comments, insults, memes, etc. I was touched by enough kind people reaching out to add some more. I dont think i can stomach another comment reading though so please dont expect me to react anymore. Notifications are off. Posted a 80k loss screenshot of part of my portfolio. Another 30k was lost in another account. https://imgur.com/a/jMvs9DR

1. ""only bet what you can afford to lose"" doesn’t really make sense. Dont use that saying to convince yourself to make risky gambles. I could afford to lose 110k in the sense that i won't starve, i would still have a roof over my head, and i still have 30k i left that i promised to myself i wouldnt touch. But i lost things i didn't expect. Like my passions for my hobbies, a healthy exercise habit, my mental health after recovering from depression during college. Even during the time i was trading, i also hated how it felt. I was glued to the ticker and was losing connection with real life relationships.  Before you use the money you think you are willing to lose. Try spending a part of that amount on yourself. Get yourself some luxuries, some experiences, maybe travel, take a sabbatical from work, or spend it on someone close to you.  Its all numbers on the screen when trading, so its easy to lose a sense of it all. Afterwards, imagine losing the ability to do all that and only proceed if youre ok with that. 

2. For those who think this isnt something a normal person could go through. I saved roughly 60-70% of my paycheck the past 3 years. I made sacrifices on lifestyle and luxuries. 

3. For those that still want to go on, i sure cant stop you. Maybe some of us need to learn a lesson firsthand. Might be better even to learn early on before you have a family with hundreds of thousands saved up over decades. This might help. 

Looking back, i definitely had chances to make money.  I was thinking about RKLB when it was $5 (now $25). I had a chance to jump into RDDT when it was still $80. I considered googl at 165 since the bad news seemed overblown.   Even at my most insane already down 50k, before i lost it all i almost went all in in on christmas eve with 1 week dte options on tsla calls.  Instead i did it on the Friday afterwards hoping for a similar bounce to recover the from the drop after fed earnings.  If you get into single stocks, crypto, options it's a lot riskier. Youre going to have to be lucky with the timing. Youre also going to have to be disciplined with your strategy.  

When you make your bet. If you win, stop.  i hope you become happy. I hope you get more time to pursue your passions. To spend time with family and friends. To become a person you are proud of. 

If you lose, i hope you recover. Never gamble again. Life will be harder. But, maybe we can still find a part of that happiness. I dont think we really want money. We just want a more human experience. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hr783s/gains_are_not_worth_the_risk/

I'm typically a very risk averse investor. I made one risky play in 2021, lost 50% of my principal, and swore off short swing investing entirely. Since then, I have parked most of my money in ETFs and a few long-play individual stocks.

With the recent election, a few of my long plays paid off to the tune of 10k and I got greedy and moved back to the HOOD. I made an additional 15% at first, but then the FOMO hit and I tried to chase TSLA and LUNR back to back, losing 25% of my gains in the process. This made me go full paperhands and liquidate.

I come to you degenerates to ask a simple question: how do you cope with this sort of loss? Luckily, I'm not forced to move to the local BK dumpster due to this move, but it just feels so bad. I went from pay for my holidays to losing two months of rent in a few swipes.

**TLDR (cuz who here can actually read):** Idgaf about TSLA as a car company, soon noone else will too. Due to China and nerds making insane tech, humanoid robotics will be HUGE by late 2024. TSLA the company that will win this race. Market will realize in a cuppa months. Market for this is 20-100T USD with infinite growth potential. TSLA is quietly becoming the NVIDIA of humanoid robotics.

AI hype has hit the street, you know what that calls for: it's time to pivot to what the old f\*cks on the street is blind to (cuz they're so old).

Humanoid robotics. Any hedge fund manager would laugh, that's why it's genius.

1. Robotics has been around for a long time, but try programming a robot the same way you program a computer and ofc it will fail. It can't reason the way we reason. Since AI popped off, robotics has been reaping the rewards. While yall sleeping, terminator is being built. Check rate of progress from 2022 -> 2024, it's insane and show no signs of slowing.
   1. This is not the boring toyota drunk robots that can't do sh\*t. This is solid progress made at supersonic speeds on making robot workers for real. There is no limits to this actually working, it's an engineering problem at this point and a matter of time.
2. Ofc Xi Jing Ping is sharper than any of the dementia patients sitting in congress. China makes savvy decisions and guess what their plan is: **500 humanoid robot workers / 10 000 ppl by 2025. That is** **3.8 million humanoid robots.** They have put their money where their mouth is and gone b a l l s deep on investment into this. They are showing good results and making insane progress quickly.
   1. The implications here alone are huge: China US rivalry won't die anytime soon. This will force the hand of the US. A trump win would be huge as he can see stuff like this coming. He just needs to talk about it to legitimize the industry, and he surely will.
3. The market for humanoid robots is as big as the market for manual labour as long as the bots can perform the tasks efficiently. Analysts forecasts don't count towards the trajectory we are on. IE THE MARKET IS CURRENTLY 30% OF WORLD GDP WITH NEAR INFINITE GROWTH POTENTIAL.

Here is why TSLA will be a huge winner in this.

* Name of the game in AI is training data, talent and compute. Tesla has huge training data advantage as their vision models already are extremely good.
   * They have already chugged away at this problem for years and years as the chip needs to be inside the robot, and not in some huge gpu datacenter. Guess what they have in their cars: A lightweight, energy efficient chip for exactly this type of processing.
   * They have the human talent and is well regarded in the AI industry. Altough Grok so far has sucked, Elon realizes that it's immensily important to get this model smarter and is putting heavy focus on that. This is directly to augment their tesla bots with reasoning capabilities. Grok is specifically designed to solve reasoning unlike other AI models where the focus is more towards workplace efficiency.
   * They already have a multimodal model with language understanding inside their bots.
   * We should see actually useful humanoid bots working in their factory this year. They will 100% use them internally a lot before selling anything. After proper field tests and refinement the market will be GASPING for these bots. They don't even need to be anywhere as close to good as perfect, they just need to be as good as 70iq darren in minnesota doing the same repetitive task over and over again. We already have that intelligence in language models today.
* Lack of AI day: To quote deranged Elon: *"" Some of our competitors look at what we do on a frame by frame basis. The same happened with Battery Day. So we have to be a little cautious, but some kind of update would be good to do. Will discuss with the team, maybe something later this year. Our main goal with these AI Day things is recruiting and to change the perception of Tesla as a car company.""*
   * Essentially, AI day has not happened bcause they don't want to give up their competitive edge, not because of lack of progress. Once Investors realize TSLA are capable as an AI company, market will reflect that.
* Manufacturing. Idc if figure01 from figureAI is good as balls, they have ZERO experience in manufacturing. Manufacturing these bots will be the hard problem to solve. There is no better company set up for this than TSLA. (MSFT is bull case long term too btw)
   * TSLA CAN TEST THESE BOTS LIVE IN THEIR OWN FACTORIES WHILE DEVELOPING, THE ADVANTAGE IS ENOURMOUS. Having integrated development for exactly the type of customers they would sell to once it's mature.
   * TSLA has walked the road of going from startup to one of the leading EV manufacturers. They continually develop their manufacturing processes, taking insane risks to make it more efficient. THERE IS NO OTHER COMPANY BETTER SET UP TO GET MASS PRODUCTION OF THESE BOTS GOING ONCE THEY'VE REACHED A VIABLE PRODUCT
* Chinese competition: China might very well beat tsla to the punch in this, this is good. Why? Because US would NEVER rely on china to make them their robots. They will turn this into a case of national security faster than i can inseminate my 5'2 mewtoo build gf.

And I haven't even gotten to the best part yet: it doesn't matter if these robots can take over the world or not, ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT INVESTORS AT SOME POINT THINK THEY CAN. Riding the hype 'bubble' is irrelevant, only thing that matters is being ahead of the bubble.

As engineer, I see no reason that this will be a bubble, just a matter of time. What will be tricky is getting manufacturing up to scale, but from a moon case scenario - that doesn't fkn matter. All that matters is a belief that it will happen and tsla stock price will reflect it. There is NO DOUBT that they are the US company best set up to do this.

**MY POSITION:** Call options for TSLA 350 by dec 2025. (retrad bookie won't let me go higher)

**MY PREDICTION:** TSLA anywhere from 400 - Nvidia levels of valuation (750+) by late 2025. Short term we prolly won't see any gains on tsla due to this development hasn't gotten any hype yet but sometime this late summer / fall (Elon time accounted) we should see the hype about this getting started for real.

Started SPY calls in 2020 and the account became $15k when COVID was first announced. Closed all positions. Withdrew whatever was left.
Started in 2021 fresh with $40k deposit, made it to $75k on TSLA calls. Then made the biggest bad decision in my entire life to yolo that into far OTM BB leaps expiring in 2022 and 2023. Poof all gone.



Did not trade in 2022 and early 2023.
Became interested because I saw regards posting gains mid 2023.

These things are true:


1) Cybertruck is not a failure. Demand is still high.


2) FSD continues to improve and is postured better to scale than any of its competitors including wAyMo. FSD is transformational, a lot of you boneheads just refuse to admit it. FSD will be successful. But “muh LiDaR”. Shut up. You know nothing about sensors, inference, AI, etc.


3) Tesla will be the king of EVs for the foreseeable future. No competitor is even close.


4) Tesla continues to print money and hoard money. All this talk about “TSLA doesn’t trade on fundamentals only musk failed promises” is equally regarded. They’ve been successful at reinvesting in areas where they either created demand or already have demand. TSLA is a successful fucking company, deal with it, idiots.


5) “But musk is a liar who manipulates the stock”. Shut up. TSLA isn’t a conspiracy. This often referenced “cult” doesn’t have enough money combined to move the stock $1.


6) Robotaxi will turn out to be a success.

In 1 year, when it rolls off the production line, you will be able to hail a Robovan, configured to have a bedroom. It will pick you up in the city center, in the evening, and you will sleep in it, while it drives you outside of the city. It will find parking and drop you off at 8 AM in front of your workplace, with a hot coffee and breakfast, which will have been delivered into the Robovan while you slept. I believe this is 1-2 years away.

Imagine you can live in a robovan for $8 a day (or $1 per hour)...basically IN THE CENTER of New York. That's $2800 per year, or $140,000 in a lifetime. You wouldn't be able to buy a cardboard box in NY for that price.

I had kind of been thinking of these shares as a retirement fund but now thinking maybe there’s something smarter I can do. Any insight is appreciated, thanks y’all. Edit: Should’ve specified this originally but I started with 10 shares at $199 a piece. This split 5x and then 3x so I’m now at 150 shares ~26k currently.  

Update: I think what I’ve decided to do is sell covered calls with my shares for premiums in the meantime.

**TSLA - The big-Brain Hedge You are still too Dumb to Consider**

Tesla is the most overvalued clown car on the market. It looks like shit, it’s priced like shit and the groupies make it sound like Musk just invented teleportation, cured baldness, and colonized Mars simultaneously. **Spoiler Alert! >!He didn’t!<.**

1. When the Market loses hype momentum, TSLA Gets Nuked ☠️ . Overvalued growth names like Tesla get slapped like a hookers cheeks behind Wendy’s, especially if JPow pulls the wrong face.

2. Buying OTM put spreads is a small cost to hedge your brainless GOOG upside. If TSLA drops 20%, you’re eating so many tendies you’ll need a stairmaster to get to bed.

**TLDR** **GOOG Calls** Buy it, hold it, shut up. It’s free money. **TSLA Put Spreads** Buy a cheap put spread. If the market slips, TSLA dumps, and you get paid.

If the market moons, GOOG wins. If the market dies, TSLA pays for your next YOLO. Either way, you’re not left high and dry like the rest of the regards here.

Don’t fumble this you fucking idiot.

Eli Lilly has been having major wins since their earnings. Their drugs are no longer in shortage, Zepound was found to have cardiovascular benefits, and their once a week insulin is showing equal results to daily insulin injections.

The cardiovascular benefits from zepound is huge because patient insurances are more likely to cover drugs like this, without patients having to try other medications since it’s an actual benefit that no other fat loss meds have and it help lower the risk of their patients being in the hospital, which will save insurance companies more money at the end.

The weekly insulin is HUGE. The biggest complaints patients have is the amount of times they have to inject themselves throughout the day. The benefit this will have, is that both type 1 and type 2 diabetics can use this and there is a smaller risk of hypoglycemia/lower blood sugar since there’s no defined peak with the insulin.

PS - I should add one more thing.  Long term, this decline is better for TSLA as this gives them time to take lead from their US and EU competitors.

Either:

 A) shareholders vote yes and board gives Elon musk 56 billion.  In this scenario, TSLA earnings go down by 56 billion.  Is this already priced in or does TSLA stock drop accordingly?  

Or, 

B) shareholders vote no and the board gives it to him anyway.  Or maybe the board sided with unhappy shareholders and face the wrath of an epic Elon musk tantrum? In this scenario, TSLA shareholders are unhappy and jump ship either way.  Is this already priced in or does TSLA stock crater to more realistic numbers?

I’m very interested to hear if there are alternative scenarios where the stock price isn’t impacted by this vote on June 13?  

It seems the June 13 vote (I think they need to report results within 4 days) will be more consequential than any earnings report, right?

Got lucky as sold these risky options at the peak of TSLA a few weeks ago. I didn't analyze the Greeks or anything other than seeing that the price would have to go up considerably after an already huge run to lose money. 

My question is how can I retroactively analyze these to see what the Greeks looked like or what the conditions were that aligned with my intuition. 

Most likely this was just luck , but I'd like to get more into option selling to profit from theta/vega. 

These felt like absolutely free money and went positive immediately. 

My logic was that the stock was up 100% in a month. High vol, the company is clearly overvalued, and over 1 trillion in market cap. If I were to take major loses on these, Tesla would have to add another trillion in market cap in the next few months. I didn't see that happening.

333,1gbydry,2024-10-25 16:28:46,TSLA shares add billions to Elon Musk's net worth,"Elon Musk's net worth is estimated to have grown by tens of billions of dollars on Thursday, when Tesla ( TSLA ) shares hit their highest price ever. With Friday's trading volatility, his wealth is expected to increase even further.

On Thursday, Tesla reported mixed earnings, but the results were encouraging, with investors focusing on several factors including strong margins, earnings per share, net income, and the company's lowest-ever cost per item sold. This was Tesla's first earnings growth in seven quarters.

Much of this growth may also be attributed to Musk's new round of promises.

He predicted that Tesla will start offering carpooling in at least two states next year (California and Texas), where he plans to get approval from “fully unsupervised” Fully Self-Driving (FSD) regulators. Musk also revealed his “best guess” for 2025 deliveries, which he said will increase by 20 to 30 percent, as Tesla plans to start selling more affordable models in early 2024. Tesla plans to sell more than 1.81 million electric vehicles in 2024.

In an earnings call with analysts, Musk said, “I predict Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world, and probably by a long shot.”

Musk controls nearly 13 percent of Tesla's outstanding shares, but could buy more at a steep discount if his compensation plan is approved by the courts. He also owns a majority stake in SpaceX, which he leads, as well as artificial intelligence startup xAI and social media platform X (META) (formerly Twitter).

Tesla's gains on Thursday boosted Musk's net worth to about $270 billion, up $33.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The index is updated at the close of the New York market. The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires Index is expected to grow by $26 billion on Thursday to about $269 billion. Musk's net worth increased by another $3 billion to nearly $273 billion as of Friday, Forbes reported.

The second-richest person on the list is Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) founder and Musk ally Larry Ellison, with a net worth of $213.8 billion, according to Forbes. He was followed by Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with $207.7 billion and $200.5 billion, respectively.

Tesla shares were up more than 2 percent in regular trading Friday morning at about $266 a share, up 55 percent in the past six months. The stock is up just 6 percent so far this year.",https://i.redd.it/luej8p3qixwd1.jpeg

337,1h2y4dg,2024-11-29 22:51:59,Finally Hit $100k in Robinhood After Years of Grind,"First post ever on Reddit albeit a long one so buckle up fellow degens!
Been lurking for 6 years, finally made a new Reddit account to share this milestone. Started this journey back in 2017 in Robinhood, rode the highs and lows, and at one point even saw my portfolio drop to just ~$1K back in July 2022 (see screenshot #2) . But here we are in 2024, looking at ~$110k and up $47k (~76%) all-time! (Still quite can’t beat the benchmark yet; SPY’s got me outpaced in the long term 🥲)

The Ups and Downs

Looking back, it’s been one heck of a rollercoaster. As you can see in my all-time chart, there were some major dips along the way. The journey wasn’t linear; there were times when I felt like the portfolio was just bleeding out, but I stuck with it, made some strategic moves, and kept adding funds whenever possible. 

After starting with the modest account balance of about roughly 18k back in Q4 2017, I steadily added funds to my portfolio over time, especially after seeing triple digit returns in NVDA, SQ and double digit gains in bunch of blue chip stocks; held some Chinese stocks like Luckin Coffee (before it got delisted from NASDAQ) . Got the account to a decent level.
Then went completely ‘regard’ and got into options 😅. Did well initially then hit the rock bottom reaching as low as $998 (see aforementioned screenshot #2). Added about 9-12k over next few months (see screenshot #3) to be able to trade again. No options but used margin money to almost double my account first. Then, as the bull market kicked in after bottoming out in October 2023, the account continued to rise. Later, I employed slightly more aggressive options strategies to reach my current position.

Key Moves 
The past 18 months have been all about- researching a shit ton (more!) and making mostly informed decisions mixing with some gut feeling, using Reddit (of course), stocktwits, yahoo finance, various research firms, reports, interviews, Fidelity, CNBC, etc

Current Portfolio includes: 
•	PLTR, bunch of Semi stocks including NVDA, TSM.
•	Blue Chips (duh!) 
•	Growth stocks like SOFI, SQ, 
 •	ETFs and a few dividend/yield stocks like QQQ, IJH, XLE, JPEQ, etc. 
•	Credit Put Spreads, LEAPS, CSPs, and CCs
	•	PLTR and semi stocks, plus bluechi
Missed out on a 10x gain on NVDA (sold too early); funny enough never went long on TSLA or got into some of the group’s fav stonks from back in 2020-21 (you know which ones 💪🏽), but holding PLTR since 2020 has been solid.
I also hold stuff long term on other platforms- Fidelity and Webull including most of my PLTR shares. Can’t go full degen and YOLO everything just on Robinhood alone; you gotta diversify 😭

Shoutout to all the legends here on WallStreetBets for the crazy ideas, inspiration, and advice. Couldn’t have done it without this community! Here’s to even bigger gains ahead. Let’s keep riding this wave together! ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h2y4dg

339,1gne1e0,2024-11-09 16:38:10,TSLA Potential Bearish Next Week,"Next week look at potential bearish TSLA crash

Tesla’s recent price action suggest a possibility of a pullback, potentially to the $307 level, before moving up to the $335 range. Analysts have noted that Tesla’s RSI is over 80, placing it in an “overbought” category, which often leads to a temporary pullback as investors take profits. Additionally, technical indicators show that the stock may face resistance near $335, suggesting it may first need to “cool off” with a slight dip before any attempt at higher levels.

If Tesla does pull back to around $307, it could serve as a consolidation phase, allowing the stock to gather momentum for a push upward. However, this movement is contingent on overall market conditions and investor sentiment staying supportive. Some sources view this pullback as a healthy correction within Tesla’s ongoing uptrend, while others suggest that breaking below $307 could trigger further declines.

In summary, a pullback to around $307 is likely, but it should be monitored closely, as further decline would indicate potential support level testing around $288. 

While it’s difficult to predict Tesla’s exact movements over the next week, there is some consensus among analysts that the stock could face further volatility.

The price is currently above $320, with analysts having varying opinions about where it could go in the near future. Some predict a potential pullback to the $220–$250 range, particularly considering concerns about profitability and broader market conditions. Other more optimistic forecasts suggest that Tesla could eventually see a rebound, with some price targets as high as $350, but this would be contingent on Tesla maintaining strong market position and positive news, such as advancements in their self-driving tech.

Given these mixed views, while a pullback to around $230–$240 is possible, it is equally plausible that the stock might stabilize around the $300 mark or rise, depending on the broader market trends and company performance.

Market hype is dying down after this past week, people are taking out profits and we are looking at a big potential dip in the stock. Overvaluation and Tesla having a bad year so far if we talk sales and production; the uptrend is most likely over and if you haven’t already this could be a good time to sell. The risk is way too high for minimal profit margins.

(It all depends on how much Elon Musk will post on Twitter/X lol)

Elon got levered to his substantial tits through his Morgan Stanley bankers, borrowing against the value of his TSLA shares. Then he borrowed even more to buy Twitter, which he didn’t realize put all his wealth at stake until it was too late. So he tried to back out, but the courts said no. 

Now TSLA has declined by almost 50% from its peak, and oh yeah the Delaware court threw out his $55B pay package as unfair. So he doesn’t even have a lot of the shares he borrowed against, and the stock has tanked, and he hasn’t been able to get SpaceX public and he is fucked and all his shares will go to Morgan Stanley if the stock gets below the price on his margin loans. 

That price? $500. But it’s $165 you say! Yes, but back when you were in middle school the stock split 3 for 1. $500/3 = $166.66. 

The stock has never made it to the options close (which includes after hours) below $166.66. That’s because Elon and MS have defended it to avoid disaster. It is now below $166.66. 

Will it close below? I don’t know, but you can only defend a stock (probably by buying calls that force trading desks to buy stock to hedge, increasing your risk) for so long, and we’re one bad market day from the dam bursting.

6M - 5,576,801 = 423,199 produced cars in Q1 2024



Current Q1 revised estimates from analysts and experts:

Ives (Wedbush): 425,000 (was 475,000)

Gary Black: 425,000

Troy Teslike: 484,000

Tom Narayan: 446,000 (was 500,000)

Morgan Stanley: 425,400 (was 469,400)

Deutsche Bank: 414,000 (was 427,000)

George Gianarikas: 420,000 (441,000)




The actual Q1 production numbers aren’t being announced until Tuesday.

Buy TSLA poots on Monday before the announcement drops on Tuesday.

With earnings on 4/17 and shit Q1 numbers already known, TSLA should continue to bleed leading up to earnings.



I’m currently holding a small position of 175P 4/5, but will be adding 150P for late April on Monday.



EDIT:

Estimates from analysts/experts are for deliveries, not production. So for 423k produced, deliveries will be even less.

Factoring in the weekend, I’ll revise my estimate to 423-433k produced, and 410-420k delivered.

Also, it’s possible (but in my opinion unlikely) that the 6M milestone was reached at an earlier date than today, which would make all these estimates false.

-TSLA and GOOG/GOOGL destroyed the market out of pure happenstance that it caused a chain reaction throughout the market as a whole.

I've done a bit of reading and I think the first theory is more probable as GDP is already expected to come in lower than Q1. It won't be enough to spur on a recession as ""healthy consumer spending"" helped a slow decline. GDP will still be up at least 1.8%, I don't expect anything less but I'm also not an economist so I can't say much to that point.

376,1dhou8r,2024-06-17 03:36:57,Plan to short TSLA,"Why:

Tesla sales have been slowing and tesla inventory has been building. This is apparent from reports of inventory build up around their factories, Q1 reporting, layoffs, and the April 2nd update.  The following site also shows an inventory increase but I do not trust this source entirely since some of the basic functionality on this site is broken. [https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4#google\_vignette](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4#google_vignette)

The recent tesla layoffs (late April) were a crossed the board and un-structured; reported as \~10% of the workforce. I suspect that it may have been larger than that but have nothing to back that up. They were un-structured as employees were given no notice and some key divisions were let go in mass (supercharger team) which were later brought back on. Employees were given 2 months of severance pay to prevent a WARN act lawsuit. Payment was scheduled to go out 45 days after termination. All in all we can expect that for this quarter payroll will be approximately unchanged for Q2 reporting while production efficiency will have been reduced by more than 20% (reduced moral, key employees will have been let go, other employees will need retraining to fill vital roles). this means less than 80% of the work for 100% of the pay which means reduced margins in Q2.

Speculation: Tesla does not have updated models that would entice current model 3/Y (their bread and butter) owners to buy a new Tesla. Most people who wanted a Tesla have already bought one. Competition in the EV market is building; many auto makers now have EV's available that are more attractive to the every day driver.

Tesla is way behind now on autonomous vehicles. Waymo is already online in Phoenix and San Francisco and is being brought online in LA. Tesla rejected radar and lidar technology which is rapidly decreasing in cost. GM, Hyundai, BMW and other manufactures already have level 2 advanced cruise control (this is what FSD is) online. BMW will be releasing a level 3 ACC soon. Tesla dropped the ball and is already late to the market for fully autonomous cars and is falling behind on level 2 ACC. 

 [https://www.bmwblog.com/2023/07/26/bmw-level-3-self-driving/](https://www.bmwblog.com/2023/07/26/bmw-level-3-self-driving/)

Tesla's robot, optimus, has not been shown to do anything useful beyond acting as a pick and place machine (these have existed since the 80's). Optimus can barely walk and is far behind Boston Dynamics (mostly owned by Hyundai). Optimus is a dead end and a pipe dream; Tesla is many years behind other companies and it's not clear if this technology will be useful considering the competitive wages of overseas workers. 

After the vote last week TSLA shot up in the pre-market then fell on Thursday and Friday. My guess is that a few, or even one, large share holder was backing out of Tesla; this was expected since this was a very divisive vote. The fan boi's have been pushing Tesla stock hard lately and although I have no proof I suspect that many influencers on youtube, twitter, and main stream media are somehow profiting through a back door means to pump Tesla and have been for some time. I have the feeling that most of us, or at least the people who have enough control to actually move markets, are seeing through Elon's BS and just need a catalyst to take a closer look and drop TSLA from their portfolio's.

What:

I plan to use \~10% of my portfolio to buy out of the money puts on 1JUL24 expiring 19JUL24. Strike price should be about -10% from stock price at that time. Depending on the severity of the 2JUL24 report from Tesla I may see either a sudden drop or a slow decline in the stock price leading into 17JUL24. After market on 17JUL24 I am expecting another drop and will close my position at market open 18JUL24 with out regard to price.

She continued: ""Most analysts have Tesla classified as an auto company. It isn't. It isn't at all. It's a robot, energy storage, AI company, and its margins will show through.""

""The auto industry -- Ford and GM -- is backing away from EVs. That's a big mistake because the only way they'll become profitable is to scale [EVs.] So they're basically ceding the market to Tesla and they will have obsolete products as Tesla's cars drop into the $20,000 to $25,000 range within five years, compared with their average of $30,000 to $45,000.""

383,1bollba,2024-03-26 22:43:08,TSLA 420.69 by end of the year,"Hi regards,

I am pissed. TSLA just go down and down and down everyday. I bought the dip on stock, it keeps on dipping, bought the dip on calls, it keeps on dipping, bought the dip on the car itself, well at least the car price stopped dipping. But only after I got the car, then I realize how good the car is.

Then I asked myself, why the stock keeps going down? checked on X, everybody said interest rate is too high, demand problem etc. I was thinking, everybody around me seems fine, **Papa Powell said the US economy is robust, job market remain tight etc, overall, everything fine!**

But still... we got a problem, that's fine... but more importantly how are we gonna **solve this problem**? ads put on youtube, X, now even on facebook,so where are the demands? where?

here is what I did. I am so broke, I pulled out my phone, registered uber. Went on the road and make some $$$ buy more tsla calls.

**why uber? because people who use uber are either:**

1. **Does not have a car (potential buyer).**
2. **have a car, can't drive themselves, but need transportation. (potential FSD buyer)**
3. **Uber is MULTI-NATIONAL, regards all over the world can participate in this. If we regards can pull this off, imagine suddenly tesla uber showing up everywhere in the world overnight. Tesla gain more awareness, lead to demand picking up. I'm pretty sure they will make another movie about it.**
4. **Get paid while doing this, Ubering in Tesla/EVs has a HUGE advantage over ICE when doing short trip. If you calculate the math, its about 13-25% more earnings. It's roughly about $23- $26/ hour before mileage deduction**
5. if you are 100% tsla, you gonna need to drive uber to supplement some income anyway.

I have done 200 trips so far. This is what I gathered from this small sample size.

1. lots of people (25% at least) doesn't even know how to open the tesla door!!!! that means they didn't even get into one of the tesla yet. At least in my area, that's the situation.
2. They LOVE LOVE LOVE the white interior and the roof, said they have never experience a car so clean and elegant! I said yeah Tesla is great, but I didn't say I clean the mess after they left everytime.
3. Lots of people asking me about the range anxiety, their information is still lagged in 2019. they don't know how long is the battery range, they don't know how fast the battery charge at home and super charger, they just don't know.
4. Lots of people asking me about the how does driving tesla feels like? I replied with my broken English to them, listed all the pros, cons I know of. They are very very surprised on no oil change for tesla.
5. Lots of people still think tesla is a 60k+ car instead of 30k-40k car.
6. Some customers specifically ordered uber green/ green comfort, I asked them why is that, they said the Tesla experience is too good.
7. Some people's friend went tesla, they can never go back to ICE.

There are many more, but my smooth brain cant list all of them out.

&#x200B;

**So in the end my smooth brain concluded that, these mfs just don't know!!!! The product is awsome@@! but they just don't know!!!! They are NOT gonna buy if they don't know!!! That's why we got a demand problem!!! Thats why the stock is dipping and dipping and dipping@@!**

&#x200B;

**So I propose Mission TSLA$420.69 to all of those regards AROUND THE WORLD have major TSLA position, and have a tesla car.**

1. uber, spread the words. Uber has destination mode, you can pick up some folks on your way to work/school, and on your way back home.
2. if you know how to create website or any other way/ form of plateform, create one. and let All the people who want to participate this together register. get each driver a QR code to post on the back of the driver/ passenger seat. Beside the QR code reads something like...""Scan here if you like to know more about my tesla experience"".
3. uber rider then can scan QR code, sound will pop up from their phone, driver start sharing. Be objective, say the pros, but make sure you also don't left out the cons. Honesty and sincerity is the best way.
4. also Post your referral link QR behind the seat
5. and then we can even let the rider take some sort of survey etc. to collect some data
6. let riders record a 10 sec vid of what they what to tell elon, if we manage to pull this off, mail it to elon
7. we can brainstorm more

&#x200B;

**More people know about it and experience it, more Teslas will be sold. Then We go tendie town.**

Not financial advise, you do you.

&#x200B;

I have been ALL IN on Tesla since Feb 2022 (had 571 shares). The ups and downs have been brutal and I am tired of watching my money go down after a big run up. Everyone says, don't time the market because it is impossible. Well, this time I gave in and I pulled out of the Tesla this morning after the big run it made this week. Now at an ATH it feels nice, but I am also terrified of Tesla going up further. I am a Tesla bull and believe the stock will be worth around $2,000 in the years to come. I also feel like the stock is currently at a local maximum. I am hoping that the stock drops so I can buy more tesla stock at a lower price and basically ""steal"" more shares. The weird thing about all of this is that you will never find a bigger Tesla bull then me, but at this very moment in time, I am actually hoping the stock drops so I can buy more shares. Has anyone else felt like this? It is a very awkward place to be. It is nice to lock in the profits, but terrifying to be ""off"" the tesla train at the moment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gbwocj/i_pulled_out_of_tesla_after_3_years_waiting_to/
392,1d75paw,2024-06-03 14:24:40,Could PLTR go on a TSLA-like Run (70%) if Included in SP500?,"On June 7th, S&P 500 is set to rebalance and Palantir will be eligible for the third time. With the spotlight on AI and Palantir's continued strong performance, there's a very high likelihood it is included in the S&P, which could lead PLTR going on a Tesla-like run. 

First, let me break down why Palantir is a great candidate for inclusion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index involves meeting several stringent criteria related to market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and corporate governance. For Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to be considered a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion, it must satisfy these key requirements:

Market Capitalization: A company must have a market cap of at least $14.6 billion (as of 2023). Palantir's market capitalization has been above this threshold for a while.

Liquidity: Companies need to have adequate liquidity, with a high trading volume. Palantir's shares are actively traded, reflecting strong investor interest and sufficient liquidity.

Financial Viability: The company must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the last four quarters combined. Palantir has demonstrated profitability, reporting positive GAAP EPS in recent quarters​ (InvestorPlace)​.

U.S. Based: Companies must be U.S.-based, with the majority of their assets and revenues derived from the U.S. Palantir fits this criterion, being headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and deriving significant revenue from U.S. operations.

Public Float: At least 50% of a company's shares must be in the public float. Palantir's public float percentage is adequate to meet this requirement, with substantial institutional ownership indicating wide distribution among public shareholders

Palantir meets all the eligibility criteria, the only which could be a problem is corporate governance, ie, the insiders own a lot of shares of the company; however there are tons of examples of other companies that have a similar structure.

As many of you know, Tesla went on a 70% in the weeks leading up to and the month following its inclusion. However, it's not alone. Many other ""sexy/high-profile"" names go on epic runs when SP500 inclusion is announced. 

1. Twitter (TWTR)
Inclusion Date: June 7, 2018
Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $26 billion
Performance:
Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on May 21, 2018, Twitter's stock increased by approximately 14%.
Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, Twitter's stock increased by about 5%.

2. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)
Inclusion Date: March 20, 2019
Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion
Performance:
Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2019, NXP's stock rose by approximately 10%. 
Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, NXP's stock increased by around 6%.

3. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) (AMD)
Inclusion Date: March 20, 2017
Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $20 billion
Performance:
Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2017, AMD's stock increased by approximately 12%. 
Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, AMD's stock rose by around 9%.

4. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS)
Inclusion Date: June 22, 2020
Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion
Performance:
Weeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on June 5, 2020, T-Mobile's stock increased by approximately 8%.
Month Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, T-Mobile's stock saw an increase of about 7%.
5. NVIDIA (NVDA)
Inclusion Date: November 18, 2001
Market Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $25 billion
Performance:
Weeks Leading to Inclusion: NVIDIA's stock saw a significant rise, roughly around 20-25%, in the weeks leading up to the inclusion.
Month Following Inclusion: The stock continued to perform well, with an additional increase of around 10-15%.

""S&P 500 effect,"" is a real phenomenon and I think it's even more powerful with high-profile names like Palantir. 

As mentioned earlier, Tesla went on a god-like run in the weeks leading up to and after the announcement. And I think Palantir shares many characteristics with Tesla that may see it go on a similar run. Both companies have a very high-profile CEO. Alex Karp is loved by Palantir holders just like Elon is by Tesla fanboys, which leads to my most important point: retail ownership. Palantir has a significant amount of its shares outstanding owned by retail; if SP500 inclusion is announced and institutions have to buy shares it may create a similar move like Tesla's as most palantir fanboys won't sell. Like Tesla, they believe Palantir is changing the world (look at their subreddit). 

I think buying Palantir options is a great upside play with limited downside, depending on when you purchase your options. The inclusion announcement is on Friday after hours, so you could buy Friday before close or anytime this week and sell Monday morning if its not included for a minimum loss. 

And with options being so cheap, this could be a 50-bagger if it goes to 30 bucks.

I mean, I made a Reddit scanner to look for certain keywords in comments on posts in an hour, works perfectly. It’s like 250 lines of code, and it was free. I have zero coding experience.

Someone explain why I shouldn’t go all in on puts against them and low-level development companies like Appian. Because to me, they seems like the next Chegg.

For context, I’ve already purchased some deep OTM puts a year or so out on Fiverr, Appian, and a couple consulting companies.

Edit: Because a lot of people don’t seem to know what release I’m taking about, or know its abilities, you can watch and read more [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ODaHJzOyVCQ&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE). 
You can basically share your screen with the AI, allowing it to click around for you if you are using their API. Meaning that code that it wrote? It can put it into action, your average consumer doesn’t need to know how to do that anymore. Now picture this in 6 months to a year, given how much we’ve moved forward in that same time period. 

TL;DR: Fiverr, Appian, SaaS companies are going to lose revenue.


Edit 2: Since I’ve got you all here: The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/10/24/memorandum-on-advancing-the-united-states-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence-harnessing-artificial-intelligence-to-fulfill-national-security-objectives-and-fostering-the-safety-security/) just put out a statement that they’re going all in on AI too, which I think is pretty neat

But, we all know this. Tesla smashed it this week. Am I pissed I missed it? Yes. Am I looking inwards for losing 30% this week, when the market rallied and a young degen chimpanzee could’ve made money? Absolutely. Do I think on Monday I will be buying the Tesla top? Absolutely not. 

I think there is another catalyst for Tesla. Fuck the election, fuck the new administration. That’s yesterday’s news. I’m talking Russia. 

We’ve seen Elon and Putin in headlines recently. Putin allegedly asked Musk not to activate Starlink over Taiwan as a favor to China. But unlike Sleepy Joe, Trump, a fan of Elon, and seemingly friend of Putin, will not give a shit about this communication. With the prospect of at least a ceasefire, if not all out end, to the war in Ukraine looking likely, I believe this opens up trade with Russia again. But this is where it gets interesting. We have an inside man. Elon is first in the running to reopen business in Russia. He is the business face of this administration, and I believe his targets will be set on the Russian automobile market potential. 

Some stats I have found:
- The Electric Vehicles market in Russia is projected to reach a revenue of US$2,470.0m in 2024.
- The market is expected to experience an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2029) of 18.09%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$5,673.0m by 2029.
- By 2029, it is estimated that unit sales of Electric Vehicles market in Russia will reach 61.94k vehicles.
- In 2024, the volume weighted average price of Electric Vehicles market in Russia is expected to be US$89.9k (Elmo can sell for cheaper)

Feel free to collectively shit all over me in the comments, but can you really say to yourself this is farfetched? I don’t think so. Elon will do Elon things. This is a PR and economic win for him - be one of the faces associated with ending a war, and be one of the leaders in re-intergating Russia into the global economy.

Cisco overtaking Microsoft ""certainly validates the networked economy that Cisco is revolutionising,"" said Brian Goodstadt, an analyst with the Standard & Poor Equity Group.

Microsoft, while still a strong generator of corporate profits, generates much of its income from desktop applications and operating systems. While the Internet has boosted demand for Microsoft's products, Cisco, whose routers carry most of the traffic running over the network, is seen as a bigger beneficiary of its growth and its earnings gains have far outpaced Microsoft in recent quarters.

Quite possibly, Cisco Systems, the biggest maker of equipment that powers the Internet, will become for the Internet what Microsoft Corp, the biggest software company, was for the personal computer.

Judging by Cisco's market capitalisation, investors seem to believe that Cisco could become the technology standard bearer for Internet hardware. Microsoft, which was founded in 1975 and went public 11 years later, took 24 years to become the company investors value the most, but occupied that spot for less than one year. Analysts have said Cisco, which was founded in 1984 and went public in 1986, will likely remain top dog for much longer and has a shot at becoming the first firm ever to be worth $1 trillion.

Yet, what do the books say?

GM has almost 2x the revenue of Tesla. Tesla missed its EPS targets by -16.15%. Meanwhile, GM exceeded EPS targets by 14.49%.

If that’s not enough, GM has a greater amount of assets and much more cash flow than Tesla. 

Despite this, based purely on market cap, Tesla is 14x more valuable than GM despite drastically less revenue, assets, and cash flow.

I think TSLA will eventually be something like Honda. Tesla is American, born and supported in primarily in the US.

Honda is a great company. They make lots of great products. Honda makes vehicles, cars, aircraft, motorcycles, boat motors, lawn mowers, and a Robot (ASIMO the humanoid robot) and a motor that competes well in Formula-1 racing. So, I see parallels to TSLA.

Tesla has great products: Vehicles, Solar and battery products, and charging. Eventually maybe taxis that drive themselves and/or a robot.

That said, adoption can be slow and competition is often stiff. Tesla will do a good job of competition, but I can't see where they have a monopoly or even close. Even if Cathie Wood bases her TSLA predictions on monopoly or near cornered market estimates.

I read on this reddit and post reply here and there.

I have small put options on both TSLA. I think the auto industry is headed for a slower clip in the near future.

I maintain that TSLA will be priced like a car company with some tech in the mix. Like Honda, but with more automation. Clearly with the number of people being cut from the company management knows things are slowing down. My opinion leans on the P/E ratio. The S&P 500 P/E ratio has roughly been between 15 and 25 for the last 15 years. I think TSLA is headed for a 25-35 x P/E. It is where tech some companies which make things are sitting. AAPL 28x, MSFT 35x, GOOG 26x, META 26x, TM (Toyota) is at 10x, Honda is at about 9x or 10x. TSLA is a vehicle company right now. The charging stations are a real business that seems to have longevity. And I think down the road TSLA will have material products for automation. The automatons – cars and robots are neat, but having a real product for market seems way off. And TSLA won’t be the only one.

Real products to market have often been slow to Musk and TSLA. Musk said the Cybertruck would go into production in late 2021 back when the vehicle was revealed in 2019. A small number of deliveries were made in late 2023. This was 4 to 5 years after announced. It is clear that planned products do happen, but often years after announced.

As the markets where TSLA has products become more mature, the growth prospects for the company become smaller. Sure TSLA could release a windmill, robot, something closer to real FSD, or Model X that tweets various videos of things that happen while driving, but things look like TSLA is maturing. Right now things are pivoting to a more stable and mature TSLA. And with a new product maybe it gets into the 40s maybe even the 50s. But this good company looks like the stock is overvalued. For my investments, I see TSLA headed to a PE between 25 and 35. And I think its going to get there this year and stay in that range for a while.

This is JUST the simple screenshots of ONLY OTM. To capture them all along with the big blocks would amount to nearly $1B-$2B in the last few weeks. THIS IS NOT INCLUDING ATM/ITM CALLS!

There is about 3,500 shares of TSLA in my mums Roth and my wifes account has around $100k in ITM leaps for Jan '27. Also sold a ton of 400p's for June... Hope Musk doesn't cluck my wife nor mum.

427,1gvxea5,2024-11-20 19:08:09,$RIVN: Riding to Valhalla,"Alright, degenerates. Rivian isn’t just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore—it’s the ex-nerd who’s going to show up at the 10-year reunion ripped and in a tux, ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a **10x banger** if you’re willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up, because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right.

## Why Rivian Is About to Deliver

**Tesla’s Fumbling the Ball** 

Elon’s gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites? Millennials? The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet? Yeah, they’re turning the corner to RIVN, who’s out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability, inclusivity, and not being a hot mess. Basically, Tesla’s stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian’s already at brunch ordering mimosas.

**How Rivian Could Ride Trump’s EV Rollercoaster**

You’d think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water, but here’s the twist: RIVN could totally benefit from his likely “America First” policies. With Rivian’s production fully based in the U.S., any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile, Trump’s cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight, but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla's Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian’s set to snag the benefits without the baggage, making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone’s FOMOing into TSLA right now, but RIVN is the sleeper play here, and it’s only a matter of time until the market realizes this.

**New Models That’ll Make You Feel Things** 

Let’s talk about Rivian’s R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K, it’s the hot-but-affordable option that’s ready to steal hearts (and market share). Tri-motor setup? Level 3 autonomy? Integration with Tesla’s Supercharger network? That’s not just sexy—that’s full-blown EV porn. This isn’t a one-night stand; Rivian’s building long-term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn’t inclusive enough for you Wendy’s employees, they’re adding a cheaper R3 model just for you (dumpster price point model still TBD).

**Efficiency: More Bang for Their Buck** 

Sure, Rivian’s been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow, but they’ve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B, and now they’ve found [a sugar daddy in Volkswagen to the tune of $5 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/rivian-volkswagen-production-forecast.html), exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That’s efficiency, baby.

**Analysts Are Hot for RIVN**

 Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54%. They’re hyped about Rivian’s leaner operations, aggressive production targets, and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money: [a short interest of 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rivn) means the minute this stock turns around, the squeeze will make it run.

RIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped, plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B, but they’re now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company’s market cap isn’t going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand, and they’re only valued at $10B? Seems like a steal to me.  


https://preview.redd.it/tc3jgmanu32e1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b4d1888d8fc95e1f6fc9412032bb443304282aa

## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)

**Dilution** 

Rivian’s diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW’s cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.

**Cash Burn**

Rivian’s like the guy spending money he doesn’t have to impress his date. Sure, it’s a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it’s a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he’s going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that’s all he talks about? Hell no, he’ll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.

## TL;DR: 

RIVN isn’t just another EV play—it’s *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian’s lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock’s the real deal, and I’m strapping in for the ride.

And if I haven’t sold you on it, take it instead from this guy who turned $182k into $11.7 million:

438,1bthvns,2024-04-01 22:29:02,ACHR in 2024 is like TSLA in 2012,"ACHR (Archer Aviation Inc) is a market leader in eVTOLs, which are essentially electric helicopters which are emission-free, quieter, safer, and more energy efficient (some designs have wings which allow them to glide). Since they're quieter and have no emissions, they have less restrictions in where permanent landing areas can be set up. Which is why United Airlines, US Air Force, the UAE, Blade (air taxi company), etc. are also investing in the technology.

  
Now let's compare the electrification of aviation with the electrification of cars. The only appeal EVs have is that their operating costs are lower (i.e. energy and maintenance) and that they're emission-free. Other than that, they're pretty much exactly like gas cars except they're also more expensive to buy. With eVTOLs, you get those perks out of the box. Combine that with the ability to build vertiports virtually anywhere, and you get an industry ready to boom. Not to mention that ACHR is diversified, so it'll manufacture eVTOLs as well as operate its own air taxi service. In fact, I'd say that ACHR has more upside potential now than TSLA did in 2012 because of this.

  
At this point, you're probably accusing me of comparing apples to oranges because the markets are completely different (i.e. aviation vs passenger cars). This isn't your typical long-range jet aviation though. This is urban air mobility which has short to mid range applications (e.g. airport to downtown). As use cases widen, it'll actually start taking over share of the passenger car market since commuters will turn to eVTOLs as opposed to booking rideshare and/or owning/renting cars.

  
ACHR's market cap is only $1B currently, but the helicopter market alone is valued at $50B. Imagine if it captures a good chunk of rideshare, gets a contract with Amazon, builds fully-autonomous flight, etc. It could easily become a 100x investment over the next 10 years.

  
Positions: $1,500 ACHR

EDIT: From reading the comments, it looks like a lot of concern seems to be around FAA certification. Here is the FAA's stance on eVTOLs: https://www.faa.gov/air-taxis. The stock is dirt cheap right now because it's not fully FAA certified yet, but there's a clear path to certification so it's only a matter of time. Once the aircraft is fully certified, risk goes down, and price will go up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bthvns/achr_in_2024_is_like_tsla_in_2012/

https://i.redd.it/7m7dix6tdric1.gif

Berkshire Hathaway's recent request for confidential treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the purchase of undisclosed stock(s) has sparked speculation. This move, aimed at concealing specific investments from public knowledge, suggests a strategic play by CEO Warren Buffett to continue acquiring shares without influencing the stock price. Such tactics allow Berkshire to amass significant positions at lower costs, given that any disclosed investment by Berkshire often leads to a surge in the stock's price as investors rush to emulate Buffett's moves. This scenario unfolds as Berkshire Hathaway navigates the complexities of the current financial landscape, leveraging its considerable influence and capital to optimize its investment strategy.

I have a theory that the secret accumulation of Tesla shares by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, if true, could represent a significant shift in Buffett's investment strategy, recognizing the tech and automotive sectors' transformative potential. This move could symbolize a meeting of minds between Buffett and Elon Musk, particularly with Musk's engagement in the Giving Pledge, initiated by Buffett. The potential synergy could redefine investment philosophies toward tech enterprises and forecast the impact of autonomous driving on the insurance industry, notably affecting Berkshire's Geico. This theory suggests a future where Musk's tech innovation and Buffett's investment savvy might reshape the automotive and insurance landscapes, especially in auto insurance risk management in the autonomous vehicle era.

I wouldn't put it past Buffett's team to be running a secretly coordinated campaign to negatively impact Tesla's narrative and share price. The coordinated stories of recalls that are merely software updates could be one example of this strategy. This approach would not only serve to depress Tesla's stock price, allowing Berkshire Hathaway to accumulate a more significant share at a lower cost but also exemplify the lengths to which Buffett's team might go to secure a strategic advantage in the market. This calculated move would underscore the depth of strategy employed by Berkshire Hathaway, manipulating market perceptions to favor their investment goals.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1argk38/is_berkshire_hathaways_hidden_mystery_stock/

Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances, and reinstate his compensation.McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case $345 million, well short of the billions they initially requested.

458,1ebbep4,2024-07-24 20:16:13,Tesla shares close down 12% after earnings miss for biggest slump since 2020 ,"Tesla shares plummeted the most since 2020 after the electric vehicle maker reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and another drop in automotive revenue.

The stock closed down 12% on Wednesday at $215.99. It’s now down 13% for the year, while the Nasdaq is up 16% over that stretch.

Tesla on Tuesday said auto revenue declined 7% from a year earlier to $19.9 billion while margins also fell. Total revenue increased 2% to $25.5 billion.

The company has been forced to slash prices globally and offer discounts and incentives as it faces slowing sales and rising competition, especially in China.

Tesla remains the top seller of electric vehicles in the U.S. by far, but is losing market share to a growing number of rivals due in part to its aging lineup of sedans and SUVs and the impact of Musk’s incendiary and political commentary.

Adjusted earnings of 52 cents a share for the second quarter trailed the average analyst estimate of 62 cents, according to LSEG. And Tesla’s adjusted operating margin shrank to the lowest in three years, dropping to 14.4% from 18.7% a year earlier. It’s the fourth straight quarter of shrinkage.

Investors have been focused on a number of other areas around the Tesla story, including when the company will introduce a new mass-market car to reinvigorate its lineup of vehicles. Musk said on the earnings call Tuesday that Tesla is on track to deliver a new “affordable” car in the first half of next year.

Robotaxis were a big topic on the earnings call. Musk envisions a world in which owners can authorize their Tesla vehicle to be used as part of an Uber-style ride-hailing service, with the cars driving autonomously.

When asked when he expects the first robotaxi ride, Musk said, “I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.”

Musk has a history of promising things on a particular timeline and not delivering. On Tuesday, he pushed back the date of the company’s robotaxi event to October, after previously saying it would take place in August.

“This is because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle,” Musk said, adding that Tesla is “going to show up a couple of other things.” He didn’t provide details.

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g18fon/tesla_shares_drop_6_in_premarket_after_cybercab/

The judge had tossed out Musk's record-breaking $56 billion pay in January, calling the compensation granted by the board ""an unfathomable sum"" that was unfair to shareholders.
Tesla also urged its investors to approve moving the company's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas in a regulatory filing.

Shares of the world's most valuable automaker were up 1% before the bell.

Rebecca Tinucci, senior director of the electric vehicle maker’s Supercharger business, and Daniel Ho, head of the new vehicles program, will leave on Tuesday morning, the report said.

Musk also plans to dismiss everyone working for Tinucci and Ho, including the roughly 500 employees who work in the Supercharger group, The Information said. It was not clear how many employees worked for Ho.

Tesla’s public policy team, which was led by former executive Rohan Patel, will also be dissolved, the report said.

“Hopefully these actions are making it clear that we need to be absolutely hard core about headcount and cost reduction,” Musk wrote in the email, the report said. “While some on exec staff are taking this seriously, most are not yet doing so.”

Tesla, which had 140,473 employees globally as of end-2023, did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.

Ho joined Tesla in 2013 and was a program manager in the development of the Model S, the 3, and the Y before being put in charge of all new vehicles, while Tinucci joined in 2018 as a senior product manager, according to their LinkedIn profiles.

Two other senior leaders — Patel and battery development chief Drew Baglino — announced their departures earlier this month, when Tesla also ordered the layoffs of more than 10% of its workforce.

Tesla is grappling with falling sales and an intensifying price war, which led to its quarterly revenue falling for the first time since 2020, the company reported last week.

Musk made progress towards rolling out Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance package in China, the epicenter of the EV price war, during a surprise visit to Beijing on Sunday.

That trip came just over a week after he scrapped a planned trip to India, where Tesla has long sought to start operations, due to “very heavy Tesla obligations.”

*Tesla analysts are getting increasingly wary, and the share of bullish ratings on the stock has dropped to the lowest since April 2021.

467,1eluzkf,2024-08-06 22:17:52,Elon Musk’s support for Trump pushes a corporate customer away from Tesla ,"European drugstore giant Rossmann announced Tuesday it will no longer buy Tesla’s electric vehicles for its fleet, effective immediately, citing CEO Elon Musk’s pro-Trump political support.

Rossmann, based in Germany, said in a statement that its decision was “based on the incompatibility between the statements of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the values ​​that Tesla represents with its products.”

“Elon Musk makes no secret of his support for Donald Trump,” Raoul Rossmann, a spokesperson for the company, said in a statement. “Trump has repeatedly described climate change as a hoax - this attitude is in stark contrast to Tesla’s mission to contribute to environmental protection through the production of electric cars.”

While Rossmann only purchases about 180 electric vehicles a year — and only had 38 Teslas in its fleet according to Bloomberg — the company’s decision to cut all Tesla EV purchases shows that Musk’s political decisions have begun to impact the automaker well beyond the U.S.

Musk formally endorsed Trump last month, and said he was contributing funds to a pro-Trump group he helped create called America PAC. Musk is also slated to interview the former president, Trump announced on Tuesday.

During a debate with President Biden in June, former President Trump dodged questions about what he would do, if anything, to combat climate change. And Trump has called climate change a “hoax.” He has also promised to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate agreement, as he did during his presidency, if he is re-elected in November.

According to ongoing research by Morning Consult, Republicans in the U.S. began to view Musk more favorably following his leveraged buyout of Twitter (now known as X) in late 2022. However, this has not driven an increase in Republican’s “purchasing consideration” of electric vehicles here. According to Pew Research, Musk’s reputation with left-leaning voters has declined even though they are far more likely to purchase an EV.

Rossman’s decision follows a recent survey that found a deterioration in Tesla’s brand, attributed partly to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.” While Tesla’s revenue increased 2% during the second quarter, automotive revenue dropped 7% to $19.9 billion from $21.27 billion in the same quarter a year ago.

Tesla opened a factory in 2022 in Brandenburg, Germany (outside of Berlin) and employs thousands in the country. At the end of 2023, the drugstore chain Rossmann reported that it had more than 4,700 stores and more than 60,000 employees with about half in Germany.

Tesla has faced protests by environmental activists in Germany who took issue with the company’s plans to cut down part of a forest and to use water for manufacturing in Brandenburg. Musk lashed out at protesters there, saying on X in March they’re “either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they’re puppets of those who don’t have good environmental goals.”

Tesla, Musk and representatives for Rossmann did not respond to requests for further details on Thursday morning.

470,1hbzw2i,2024-12-11 18:11:55,"Tesla shares climb to record, boosted by 64% pop since Trump election victory","Tesla shares jumped to an all-time high on Wednesday, surpassing their prior record reached in 2021, sparked by a post-election rally and Wall Street’s increased enthusiasm for Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company.

The stock rose to an intraday high of $415, which is 50 cents above its previous peak, and was on pace to close ahead of its highest finish, which was $409.97 on Nov. 4, 2021.

Tesla’s market value has swelled by about 66% this year, with almost all of those gains coming since Donald Trump’s election victory early last month. The stock’s 38% rally in November marked its best monthly performance since January of 2023 and its 10th best on record.

Musk poured $277 million into a pro-Trump campaign effort, according to Federal Election Commission filings, and turned his support for the Republican nominee into another full-time job ahead of the election, funding a swing-state operation to register voters and using his social media platform X to constantly tout his preferred candidate, frequently with misinformation.

The world’s richest person, who’s seen his net worth swell to over $360 billion, is set to lead the Trump administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.

His new role could give Musk power over federal agencies’ budgets, staffing and the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. Musk said during a Tesla earnings call in October that he intended to use his sway with Trump to establish a “federal approval process for autonomous vehicles.” Currently, approvals happen at the state level.

“The stock is responding to the Trump bump,” Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth MKM, told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” last week. Irwin had just increased his price target to $380 from $85, writing in a report that “Musk’s authentic support for Trump likely doubled Tesla’s pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection.”

On Wednesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs boosted their price target on Tesla, joining a parade of firms that have lifted their price expectation or their rating on the stock. The Goldman analysts wrote that “the market is taking a more forward-looking approach to Tesla, including with respect to its AI opportunity.”

Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have also issued bullish reports of late.

Since Trump’s victory, Musk has been accompanying the president-elect in meetings with world leaders, and began advising him and members of Congress as to which federal agencies, regulations and budget items the billionaire would like to eliminate or greatly reduce.

Tesla’s surge to a record marks a dramatic turn from its performance to start the year. The company’s shares plunged 29% in the first three months of 2024, the worst quarter for the stock since the end of 2022 and the third worst since Tesla went public in 2010. At the time, investors were concerned about Tesla’s core business, which reported declining revenue in the first quarter in part due to increased competition from China.

In its third-quarter earnings report in October, Tesla reported a year-over-year revenue increase of 8%, which fell just shy of estimates. However, the company reported better-than-expected profit, and Musk said on the earnings call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, due to “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” That forecast was ahead of analysts’ predictions.

471,1g1e9q0,2024-10-11 16:45:39,Tesla is Completely out of Touch with Needs of Taxi Services. ,"Seeing a lot of focus on the Temu Boston Dynamics bot, but not a lot of discussion on the robo taxi. 

How this thing is built tells me how out of touch and unprepared Tesla is to seriously compete in ride servicing. 

First off this thing has two seats, that alone is such a dumb design decision. It had to be Elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. What if I want to travel with a small group of people? I’m not using the LAX shuttle van at that point, I’m immediately turning to a competitor. Haven’t really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. 

One other concern I have is how Tesla primarily uses cameras. What if there are sirens and a fire truck, ambulance, or police car is blowing through an intersection. Other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound, I’m not too sure Tesla does. If not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. 

Beyond this there’s the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it’ll probably be nowhere close to. 

What are other people’s thoughts on this, did anything with this Robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you? It looks like an aesthetic toy, but not an actual product that can compete in the space. Based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle, redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2-4 years at least. To me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. 


Edit: Alright read through the comments, and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. People are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. So my choices are to buy a 30K Robotaxi (knowing Tesla’s history this WILL be priced higher) and then ALSO get a model 3 or model Y to drive around my family for ANOTHER 40K when I can just get ONE model 3 or any other self driving car, no Robotaxi and do everything I need? How is that budget friendly at all, and if there’s a nicer car with a steering wheel that self drives why would I buy something without the option of a steering wheel? 
Still a toy.
 
Also, if it’s for personal use, how does this know where to park at my office or how to get past a security gate to private property? If I live in a condo building with a garage how does it know how to get out of the parking garage and where my parking space is? It makes no sense as a personal car for a LOT of people.

And even if the majority of taxi rides are 1-2 people, why not just use a model 3 that’s 10K more, already exists, and can service that additional 15-20% of your taxi market (given the Robotaxi is definitely not gonna cost 30K and over the life of the car the extra seats pay for themselves). You also save on all the costs that it took to make a stupid 2 seater when it came to expanding production lines/capacity, testing, and designing the pointless thing. 

My opinion doesn’t change this thing shouldn’t exist, and it’s out of touch with what most people need. Total waste of time when they could’ve focused on actually competing with growing competition in the normal car space where they’re losing their competitive advantage. There’s a reason why Uber and the ex-Waymo CEO were not impressed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g1e9q0/tesla_is_completely_out_of_touch_with_needs_of/

**Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers**

&#x200B;

*When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-promised, next-generation $25,000 electric vehicle, the automaker’s stock plunged. Chief Executive Elon Musk rushed to respond on X, his social-media network.*  
*“Reuters is lying,” he posted, without elaborating. Tesla’s stock recovered some of its losses.*  
*Six months later, Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human-driven $25,000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be ""pointless” unless the car was fully autonomous.*  
*His latest remarks came in response to an investor asking: “When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?”*  
*Musk responded: “We’re not making a non-robo…,” before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added: “Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.”*  
*The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all-new, affordable mass-market EV but still planned a self-driving robotaxi. Since then, Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles.*  
*Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story.*  
*On the October earnings call, Musk said that Tesla does plan a “$25K car” – its “Cybercab,” a two-door, two-seat, fully autonomous vehicle. Musk unveiled a prototype at a Hollywood-style event on Oct. 10.*  
*Musk says Tesla will start production of the Cybercab in 2026, after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California next year. The automaker faces steep technological, regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on Musk’s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles, which echo others dating back about a decade.*  
*An all-new affordable Tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of Tesla’s strategy to become the world’s biggest automaker. For several years, Tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of Toyota, the current global sales leader. In May, Tesla dropped the 20-million goal from its latest “impact report” on progress toward sustainability goals.*  
*As recently as January of this year, Musk confirmed the plan for an all-new affordable EV in an earnings call. He said the next-generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major ""growth wave,” following the first wave with the release of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2017 and 2020, respectively.*  
*Investors and Tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a “Model 2,” slotting in below the Model 3, currently the least-expensive Tesla, starting at $42,490.*  
*In January, Musk described the all-new model as requiring “new revolutionary manufacturing technology.” But in April, after Reuters reported Tesla had scrapped the Model 2, Musk outlined a plan for “more affordable” models that could be produced “on the same manufacturing lines” as current Teslas.*  
*Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar Research Services analyst, said he believes these less-expensive vehicles will be built on current Tesla platforms and priced in the mid-$30,000s.*  
*“It was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more-affordable vehicle on a new platform,” he told Reuters. “I think Tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their Chinese-EV peers … So, they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle.”*  
*After the April 5 Reuters report that Tesla had killed the Model 2, Musk posted that day on X saying Tesla planned a “robotaxi unveil” in August. The event, delayed until October and held on a movie set near Los Angeles, underwhelmed Wall Street and drove a 9% drop in Tesla shares the following day.*  
*Some investors viewed Musk’s comments on the Cybercab – along with displays of an autonomous “Robovan” concept and humanoid robots – as short on concrete details about the products. Tesla hasn’t said whether the Cybercab will feature new self-driving technology beyond the company’s “Full Self-Driving” feature in its current vehicles. Its existing models can’t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention.*  
*The target market for the Cybercab isn’t clear. The Cybercab’s sports-car looks and two-door, two-seat configuration – a nearly extinct layout in the wider U.S. auto market – puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage.*  
*Musk, in the October earnings call, said the concept vehicle’s design was “optimized for autonomy” and would also deliver affordability.*  
*“It will cost … roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car,” Musk said. “It just won't have a steering wheel and pedals.”*",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gk7fz6/musk_now_says_its_pointless_to_build_a_25000/

Total deliveries Q1 2024: 386,810
Total production Q1 2024: 433,371

Tesla doesn’t break out sales of its vehicles by model but reported that it produced 412,376 Model 3/Y cars and delivered 369,783 of those cars. It produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027.

In the same period last year, the electric automaker reported 422,875 deliveries and production of 440,808 vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries and production of 494,989 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.

According to a mean of 11 estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts were expecting deliveries of around 457,000 for the period ending March 31. Estimates ranged from a high of 511,000 deliveries to a low of 414,000 for the first quarter, with estimates updated in March ranging from 414,000 to 469,000 deliveries.

Independent auto industry researcher Troy Teslike, whose work is closely followed by Tesla fans, had expected deliveries to come in around 409,000.

Tesla’s head of investor relations Martin Viecha sent around a company-compiled consensus based on 30 analysts’ estimates over the weekend to select investors. The consensus, which was viewed by CNBC, said analysts were expecting a mean of 443,027 deliveries and a median of 431,125 deliveries for the quarter.

Tesla faced numerous challenges in the first quarter.

Houthi militia attacks on shippers in the Red Sea disrupted Tesla’s component supply and temporarily suspended production at its German factory outside of Berlin in January. In March, environmental activists set fire to infrastructure near that same factory, depriving Tesla of sufficient operation power and again causing a pause in production.

In China, Tesla faced an onslaught of competition from domestic EV makers, including BYD and newcomers such as the phone maker Xiaomi. After sluggish sales numbers for its China-made cars in January and February, Tesla reduced production of its Model 3 and Model Y at its Shanghai plant and slashed workers’ schedules to 5 days a week from 6 and a half days.

In the U.S., reviews were mixed for Tesla’s newest model — an angular pickup dubbed the Cybertruck — which the EV maker only began to sell in small numbers in December last year.

A series of discounts and incentives appeared to be less effective in driving sales volume than in the past for Tesla.

During the final days of the first quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo the newest version of the company’s premium driver assistance system for customers in North America before handing over their cars. The system is marketed as Full Self-Driving but doesn’t make Tesla cars autonomous. They require a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

Shares of Tesla dropped 29% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since the end of 2022 and the third-steepest quarterly plunge since the company’s IPO in 2010.

476,1f2edpy,2024-08-27 11:12:08,Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he's been dumping the stock because no one wants the company's cars or robots,"* Tesla stock is in a ""quagmire,"" the longtime investor Ross Gerber has said.
* He said he'd sold about $60 million in Tesla shares amid growing concerns over the carmaker.
* Gerber told Yahoo Finance that no one seemed interested in buying Tesla's cars anymore.

  
One of Tesla's longtime investors has dumped about half his stake in Elon Musk's carmaker.



The shareholder, Ross Gerber, has said that's because no one seems interested in buying Tesla's cars or robots.



Gerber, who's been a loud critic of Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, said he had sold about 60 million worth of his Tesla shares. He told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that his investment fund still had a $50 million stake in the company.



""Over time, I've just been sort of lowering my position, because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals that were set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently, which is really to sell more cars,"" Gerber said, dismissing bullish talk on Tesla's robotics and full-self-driving tech. ""That's just a distraction from the fact that they need to sell cars, this year, and next year, and the year after, because none of this is coming anytime soon,"" he added.



Other Tesla investors have also grown skeptical and impatient over the car company's trajectory. Tesla's stock is down 13% this year, largely because of declining sales, rising competition in China, and drama surrounding Musk's legal battles.



Gerber said the used-car market was swarmed with old Teslas, adding that he'd been unable to offload his own Tesla at what he deemed a fair value.



""It's really a quagmire where you have the best products in an industry but a CEO who doesn't actually work there, who doesn't try to sell the cars,"" Gerber said, adding: ""We've seen sales go down, and that's what's happening. Sales are going down. If you're expecting a great quarter, you're wrong. They're not selling any Teslas here, other than basically, discount, discount, discount.""



And while analysts have made the case that the company is being undervalued as an AI firm, Gerber said artificial intelligence was unlikely to save the company. He speculated that demand would be poor for Tesla's humanoid robots, given doubts over Musk amid his chaotic revamp of Twitter into X.



""The simplest way to do it is, go around to your neighbors and ask them, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' And the answer is zero, OK. Nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk. Why? Who would trust it?"" Gerber said, adding: ""The last thing I need is some robot built by Elon Musk in my house, so I don't know if they thought about the marketing of this at all yet.""



Musk's leadership of Tesla has been under rising scrutiny from investors and lawmakers over the past few years. Most recently, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board of directors, calling on the executives to ensure Musk was meeting his financial responsibilities to Tesla shareholders.

477,1dtlvh3,2024-07-02 13:29:33,"Tesla reports 443,956 deliveries in second quarter, a 4.8% decrease from last year ","Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles

Total production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles

Tesla’s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.

Troy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories — Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles — but doesn’t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.

Tesla’s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.

In April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, “primarily due to lower average selling price.”

Sluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla’s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.

But the sales drop also correlated with Tesla’s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.

Tesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.

In China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.

Colin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees “declining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.” He recommends selling Tesla shares.

Wells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the “likelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes” as the year continues.

Investor focus will now shift to Tesla’s second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or “CyberCab.”

478,1bwtyff,2024-04-05 21:39:43,Elon Musk says Tesla will unveil its robotaxi on Aug. 8; shares pop,"Tesla will reveal its robotaxi product on Aug. 8, CEO Elon Musk said in a social media post on X.

Musk has spoken about the robotaxi project for years, and it could represent a major new business for the carmaker as investors grow wary of the company during a period of slowing growth.

Tesla shares rose over 3% in extended trading after Musk’s tweet.

Musk shared the release date on Friday after Reuters reported that plans for Tesla’s highly anticipated low-cost car model had been scrapped. Musk accused Reuters of “lying.”

Tesla’s robotaxi project, according to Musk’s past remarks, would allow Tesla vehicles to use self-driving technology to autonomously pick up riders for fares. In 2019, Musk said that he expected to have over 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020. Author Walter Isaacson also mentioned the robotaxi project in his biography of Musk, published in 2022.

Currently, Tesla offers advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS,) including its Autopilot option, as well as a premium Full Self-Driving “FSD” option, which costs $199 per month for subscribers. However, Teslas currently cannot operate without human intervention.

There is significant competition in the market for taxi services that use self-driving cars.

Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle unit Waymo operates driverless ride-hailing services in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and is now ramping up in Tesla’s home base of Austin, Texas.

GM’s Cruise service previously offered self-driving car services in San Francisco before being wound down under regulatory scrutiny after an accident. Since the incident, Cruise’s robotaxi fleet has been grounded, local and federal governments have launched their own investigations and Cruise leadership has been gutted.

479,1gzx5tr,2024-11-25 23:20:54,"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says","Tesla's electric vehicles likely would not qualify for California's new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if President-elect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases, Governor Gavin Newsom's office said on Monday.
Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

The company’s stock was down 1.20% in premarket deals at roughly 7:30 a.m. ET.

“As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in an internal memo cited by Reuters, which tech publication Electrek referenced in the first report of the layoffs.

“As part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization and made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10% globally,” the memo said.

CNBC was unable to independently verify the memo and has reached out for comment.

481,1gbcgse,2024-10-24 20:25:58,Tesla stock has best day in over a decade on Musk's 2025 growth projection,"Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.

The company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.

“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.

Tesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.

Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.

Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”

CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.

Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.

It “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.

A grain of salt

Musk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.

Bernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”

Musk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. 

The Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”

They pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.

The share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.

483,1c4wan2,2024-04-15 20:15:02,Tesla execs Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel depart as company announces layoffs,"Tesla executives Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel announced Monday they are leaving the electric vehicle maker and clean energy company. CEO Elon Musk thanked both departing execs on X, the social network he owns and runs as chief technology officer.

The news comes after Tesla said it is laying off more than 10% of its workforce.

Baglino had worked with Tesla since its early years, starting as a firmware and electrical engineer in 2006. He most recently reported directly to Musk as the company’s senior vice president for powertrain and energy engineering.

Patel joined Tesla in 2016 after working as a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama on climate and energy issues, among other policy matters.

Reuters recently reported that Tesla has set aside plans to make a more affordable new EV at Musk’s direction. The strategy shift includes a greater focus on developing a “robotaxi” and comes amid steep competition including from BYD and other Chinese automakers with more affordable electric cars.

Patel and Baglino had been deeply involved in battery and vehicle manufacturing, related policy, and turning Tesla into a multinational EV manufacturer. They were less involved in autonomous vehicle technology at Tesla. 

Baglino wrote in a post on X:

“I made the difficult decision to move on from Tesla after 18 years yesterday. I am so thankful to have worked with and learned from the countless incredibly talented people at Tesla over the years. I loved tackling nearly every problem we solved as a team and feel gratified to have contributed to the mission of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy, a mission that I am quite passionate about.”

Musk responded on the platform, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Few have contributed as much as you.”

As of Monday morning, Tesla had not yet updated the “leadership” information on its corporate webpage to reflect Baglino’s departure.

Patel wrote in a post on the social network, “The past 8 years at Tesla have been filled with every emotion — but the feeling I have today is utmost gratitude,” adding, “My immigrant parents worked their asses off and as a result I’m the luckiest dude. Lucky to have been a part of @BarackObama’s campaign/administration, and truly honored to have worked at @Tesla to positively changing multiple industries.”

Musk replied to Patel, saying, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Much appreciated.”

The CEO also said, in a post on X on Monday, “About every 5 years, we need to reorganize and streamline the company for the next phase of growth.”

Baglino and Patel were not immediately available for comment.

Just the sheer madness, i know its just a multiple and future growth and all that. Still, you gotta take a moment to contemplate this.

The funny thing is that Elon has outright lied/being wrong with predictions like dates for models and stuff, most recently the shenanigans with the robot at his events.

486,1gak7c4,2024-10-23 20:16:25,Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat,"* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. ""As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,"" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our ""We, Robot"" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gak7c4/tesla_shares_jump_6_on_profit_beat/

On Wednesday, Rivian announced a disappointing quarter and outlook and said it would cut its salaried workforce by roughly 10%.

Shortly after, Musk wrote on X that the rival maker of electric vehicles would go bankrupt in about six quarters on the current trajectory, adding, “Maybe that trajectory will change, but so far it hasn’t.”

“They need to cut costs massively and the exec team needs to live in the factory or they will die,” he wrote.

Musk, having gone through “production hell” and “sleeping at the factory” himself at Tesla, should know.

The billionaire has warned about Rivian’s challenges before. In June 2022, he said his advice for the company would be “to cut costs immediately across the board dramatically or they’re doomed.”

488,1c7u5kh,2024-04-19 11:07:59,"Tesla to recall 3,878 Cybertrucks over faulty accelerator pedal, NHTSA says","April 19 (Reuters) - Tesla [(TSLA.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O) is recalling 3,878 Cybertrucks to fix an accelerator pedal pad that could come loose and get lodged in the interior trim, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Friday.

A trapped accelerator pedal could cause the vehicle to accelerate unintentionally, increasing the risk of a crash, the auto safety regulator said in a [notice, opens new tab](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCAK-24V276-5059.pdf).

Tesla started deliveries of its Cybertruck electric pickup truck late last year, after a two-year delay due to production problems and battery-supply constraints.

The EV maker will replace or repair the accelerator pedal assembly at no charge and owners will be notified through letters mailed to them in June, the NHTSA said.

In the first quarter of 2024 Tesla had three recalls affecting about 2.4 million vehicles, according to a report by recall management firm BizzyCar.

However, most issues related to Tesla recalls are usually resolved through over-the-air software updates.

In February, Tesla [recalled](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recall-over-2-mln-vehicles-us-nhtsa-2024-02-02/) about 2.2 million vehicles in the United States due to an incorrect font size on warning lights and U.S. safety regulators [upgraded their probe](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recall-over-2-mln-vehicles-us-nhtsa-2024-02-02/) into the company's vehicles over power steering loss to the status of an engineering analysis.

489,1dexrh2,2024-06-13 12:27:15,Tesla pops 6% in premarket after Elon Musk says he is set for victory in $56 billion pay vote ,"Shares of Tesla popped in premarket trading, after Elon Musk said shareholders are set to approve his controversial $56 billion pay package and a resolution to move the electric carmaker’s incorporation to Texas.

At 08:12 a.m. ET on Thursday, Tesla shares were 6.39% higher in premarket trading.

Tesla shareholders have been voting on two resolutions and can have their say up to the company’s annual meeting on Thursday. The first measure under consideration is whether to green light a $56 billion pay package that shareholders originally approved in 2018, before being voided by a Delaware judge in January.

The second resolution is whether Tesla should transfer its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. That proposal was put forward after Musk asked his followers on social media platform X earlier this year whether Tesla should carry out such a move — to a resounding yes.

Musk now said that both of these resolutions are currently passing by “wide margins,” without disclosing specifics or his sourcing.

CNBC has reached out to Tesla for comment.

The initial pay package had aggressive targets for Tesla’s financial performance and market value — and, while the company has turned into one of the world’s largest electric automakers, a lot has changed since 2018.

Tesla is facing slowing growth and increased competition, especially from Chinese players. In that time, Musk also bought Twitter, now called X, and has ramped up focus on other projects, including in his brain computer interface firm Neuralink and artificial intelligence company xAI.

Critics of the pay deal argue that Musk is distracted by his other endeavors, and that the package, the largest in U.S. corporate history, is excessive. More recently, they say that Tesla’s financial performance has not been up to scratch.

Some notable shareholders have said they planned to vote against the deal, and top proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis also recommended this step. The California State Teachers’ Retirement System, a massive pension fund, likewise objected to the package, claiming the sum was too high. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has similarly come out in opposition.

Shareholders in favor of the compensation argue that Musk is integral to Tesla’s future success and that the billionaire will take his efforts elsewhere if he is not reimbursed adequately. They claim that the pay package has incentivized Musk.

Billionaire investor and long-time Tesla shareholder Ron Baron said he is voting in favor of the pay package, suggesting that Musk is key to the EV maker’s future.

“At Baron Capital, our answer is clear, loud, and unequivocal: Tesla is better with Elon. Tesla is Elon,” he said this month.

Some major investors, such as Vanguard and Blackrock, have meanwhile not said how they will cast their votes.

490,1cfwypc,2024-04-29 11:41:00,Tesla jumps 10% in premarket trade after passing key hurdle to roll out full self-driving in China,"Shares of Tesla rose sharply in U.S. premarket trading on Monday after the electric car maker passes a significant milestone to roll out its full self-driving technology in China.

The company’s share price spiked more than 10% just after 7:30 a.m. ET, as investors reacted to news surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s visit to China.

Tesla on Sunday said that local Chinese authorities removed restrictions on its cars after passing the country’s data security requirements.

The move raised expectations that Tesla’s driver-assistance software Full Self Driving (FSD) would soon be available in the country, which is the largest market for electric vehicles.

While Tesla’s electric cars are some of the most popular vehicles in China, they have reportedly been banned from some government-related properties due to data security concerns.

Separately, the Biden administration earlier this year announced a probe into whether imported cars from China pose national security risks due to their ability to potentially collect sensitive data.

FSD is an upgrade to Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistant. Tesla has offered its FSD technology in China for years, but with a restricted feature set that limits it to operations, such as automated lane changing.

Data security concerns have been a key obstacle preventing Tesla from achieving a full rollout of the system in China.

Tesla also reportedly scored a deal with Baidu that would give Musk’s firm access to the Chinese internet giant’s mapping and navigation technology for Tesla’s FSD feature.

The agreement would allow Tesla to tap into Baidu’s mapping service license, which is a requirement for intelligence driving systems to operate on public roads in China, Reuters reported, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the matter.

CNBC was unable to independently verify the report. Tesla and Baidu were not immediately available for comment.

With the license, which foreign companies can only clinch in partnership with local Chinese firms, Tesla will be allowed to legally operate FSD on Chinese roads, and its fleets will be able to gather data about traffic, road signs and routes.

The breakthrough for Tesla toward bringing its FSD self-driving technology to China marks a key win for the firm at a time when it is facing hefty competition in the Chinese market. Local rivals such as Warren Buffett-backed electric vehicle maker BYD, Nio, and Xpeng have ramped up their competition with Tesla in recent years.

BYD was temporarily the largest electric vehicle maker globally, producing more than 3 million new energy vehicles in 2023. The firm recently lost its crown as world’s largest EV maker, after a 43% plunge in sales in the first quarter.

491,1cm22gu,2024-05-07 03:16:25,More Tesla employees laid off as bloodbath enters its fourth week,"Tesla’s brutal round of layoffs entered its fourth week, with more employees posting on LinkedIn and elsewhere about receiving notice that their time at the company has come to an end.

The most recent layoffs, which were first reported by Electrek and Business Insider, appear to be hitting different segments of the company, including software, services, and engineering. Employees said they received layoff notices over the weekend and on Monday.

It’s unclear how many employees have been affected. Business Insider reported at least seven employees posted about being laid off on Sunday.

The layoffs first started last month, when Tesla began laying off what was said to be at the time 10 percent of the company’s global workforce of 140,000 people. The layoffs included Tesla’s head of EV charging, Rebecca Tinucci, as well as her entire 500-person team. Tesla’s head of the new vehicles program, Daniel Ho, was also let go.

On X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company needed to be reorganized every five years. And in an email to employees, he said the company needed to be “absolutely hard core” about the cuts and that staffers working under executives who “don’t obviously pass the excellent, necessary and trustworthy test” would be out of a job.

According to Bloomberg, Musk privately expressed a desire to lay off at least 20 percent of the company because its quarterly vehicle deliveries fell by that much.

Tesla is going through one of its toughest financial situations in years, with sales dropping and profits down 55 percent year over year. The company is experiencing increased competition, both in the US and in China, while also dealing with waning demand for EVs globally.

And Musk has been downplaying Tesla’s vehicle business in an effort to position the company as a leader in autonomous vehicles, promising to unveil a fully autonomous robotaxi later this year.

492,1bpy94c,2024-03-28 15:24:03,Xiaomi releases electric car $4K cheaper than Tesla's Model 3 as price wars heat up,"Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi said Thursday it will sell its first car for far less than Tesla’s Model 3, as price wars heat up in China’s fiercely competitive electric car market.

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country — a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss.

Tesla’s Model 3 starts at 245,900 yuan in China.

Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3′s 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday.

Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi’s car factory, for which all “key” steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.

Earlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO said on social media the SU7 would be the best sedan “under 500,000 yuan” ($69,328).

The car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers, most notably launching the Aito brand whose vehicles are often on display in Huawei smartphone showrooms.

Tesla’s Model 3 is the best-selling new energy sedan in China that has a driving range of at least 600 kilometers (372 miles) and costs less than 500,000 yuan, according to data from industry website Autohome.

BYD’s Han sedan starts at 169,800 yuan, according to Autohome.

Nio’s ET5 starts at 298,000 yuan, while Xpeng’s P7 starts at 209,900 yuan, the data showed. Geely-owned Zeekr’s 007 sedan starts at 209,900 yuan, according to Autohome.

Sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-only powered cars, have surged in China to account for about one-third of new passenger cars sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association.

Accessories

The heads of competing electric car startups Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto were among the featured guests at the Xiaomi SU7 launch event.

Lei on Thursday showed off a range of accessories such as an in-car refrigerator, a custom front-window shade, and a smartphone holder, some available for free with a car purchase before the end of April, and others for a separate price.

The SU7 supports Apple’s Car Play and can integrate with the iPad, Lei said. He also revealed driver-assist tech for highways and cities, set to be fully available in China in August.

Tesla’s Autopilot for driver assist on highways is available in China, but the company’s “Full Self Driving” for city streets has yet to be released in the country.

Despite saying Xiaomi wanted to compete with Porsche at a car tech event in December, Lei acknowledged that the SU7 had longer to go before it might be able to compete at this more premium level. He announced that the “Max” version of the SU7, aimed as a competitor with Porsche’s Taycan, would sell for 299,900 yuan.

Ecosystem of devices

The SU7 is part of Xiaomi’s recently launched “Human x Car x Home” strategy that seeks to build an ecosystem of devices connected to its new HyperOS operating system. Most of the company’s revenue is from phones, with just under 30% coming from appliances and other consumer products.

Although Xiaomi is generally known for more affordable products, its President Lu Weibing told CNBC earlier this year the company has been pursuing a premiumization strategy since 2020 — and that there are about 20 million users in that price segment who might buy the SU7.

Lu told CNBC that the SU7 will first be sold to consumers in China, and that it would take at least two to three years for any overseas launch.

The company showed off the car at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in late February, following a reveal of the vehicle’s exterior and tech in Beijing in late December.

493,1dfg8h3,2024-06-14 02:22:54,Musk says robots could make Tesla $25 trillion company — more than half value of S&P 500 ,"The entire value of the S&P 500 currently stands at $45.5 trillion, according to FactSet. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on Thursday that his company’s Optimus humanoid robots could eventually make the automaker worth more than half of that.

Musk, who characterized himself as “pathologically optimistic” at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, said Tesla is embarking on not just a “new chapter” in its life, but is about to write an entirely “new book.” Optimus appears to be one of the main characters.

Tesla first revealed its plans to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event, trotting out a dancer in a unitard that looked like a sleek, androgynous robot.

In January, Tesla showed off Optimus robots folding laundry in a demo video that was immediately criticized by robotics engineers for being deceptive. The robots were not autonomous, but were rather being operated with humans at the controls.

At the shareholder event on Thursday, Musk didn’t divulge exactly what Optimus can do today. He suggested the robots some day will perform like R2-D2 and C-3PO in Star Wars. They could cook or clean for you, do factory work, or even teach your children, Musk suggested.

As for shareholder value, Musk said Optimus could be the catalyst for lifting Tesla’s market cap to $25 trillion someday.

Speaking to a crowd consisting mostly of fawning fanboys in an auditorium at the Gigafactory, Musk promised Tesla would move into “limited production” of Optimus in 2025 and test out humanoid robots in its own factories next year.

The company, he predicted, will have “over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla” in 2025.

This is all far-out stuff even for Musk, who is notorious for making ambitious promises to investors and customers that don’t pan out — from developing software that can turn an existing Tesla into a self-driving vehicle with an upload, to EV battery swapping stations.

Getting to a $25 trillion market cap would mean that Tesla would be worth about eight times Apple’s value today. The iPhone maker is currently the world’s biggest company by market cap, just ahead of Microsoft.

At Thursday’s close, Tesla was valued at about $580 billion, making it the 10th most valuable company in the S&P 500.

Musk didn’t provide a timeframe for reaching $25 trillion. He did say that autonomous vehicles could get the company to a market cap of $5 trillion to $7 trillion.

Musk said he agreed with numbers from long-time Tesla bull Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest. This week, ARK put a $2,600 price target on Tesla’s stock by 2029, betting on a commercial robotaxi business that the company has yet to enter.

Wood’s price target equals a market cap for Tesla of over $8 trillion.

Musk’s comments at the annual meeting followed the shareholder vote to reinstate the CEO’s $56 billion pay plan, five months after a Delaware court ordered the company to rescind the package. The crowd cheered when the proposal was read aloud, and when preliminary results were announced.

Taking the stage following the readout of the shareholder votes, Musk said, “I just want to start off by saying hot d---! I love you guys.”

Tesla shares have dropped 27% this year as the company reckons with a sales decline that’s tied in part to an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China. The company has also implemented steep layoffs. Musk has encouraged investors to look past the current state of the business and more toward a future of autonomous driving, robots and artificial intelligence.

Among his boldest claims on Thursday was Musk’s declaration that Tesla had advanced so far in developing silicon that it’s surpassed Nvidia when it comes to inference, or the process that trained machine learning models use to draw conclusions from new data.

Nvidia shares have soared almost nine-fold since the end of 2022, driven by demand for its AI chips. The company is now worth about $3.2 trillion.

One concern swirling around Musk is his focus on Tesla given all of his other commitments. He owns and runs social media company X, is CEO of SpaceX, and founded The Boring Co. and Neuralink. He launched another startup, xAI, in March last year and the company recently raised $6 billion in venture funding.

Musk was asked by a shareholder at the meeting how important he is, personally, to the future of Tesla.

“I’m a helpful accelerant to that future,” he said, emphasizing his role in innovation.

He said that, when it comes to humanoid robots, other companies, including tech startups, are going after the market. Competitors include Boston Dynamics, Agility, Neura and Apptronik.

“What really matters is, can we be much faster than everyone else and our product be done a few years before theirs and be better,” Musk said.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.

Tesla’s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called “racist hate,” and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.

But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.

In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.

Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of “dedicated robotaxi.”

Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

499,1bvc05n,2024-04-04 02:33:03,"Tesla (TSLA) PT Lowered to $115 at JPMorgan, 'We are slashing our estimates and price target'","
On Wednesday, JPMorgan revised its price target for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, reducing it to $115 from the previous $130 while maintaining an Underweight rating. The adjustment follows Tesla's first-quarter delivery numbers, which significantly fell short of both JPMorgan's and consensus expectations.

Analysts at JPMorgan expressed concern that the disappointing delivery figures might impact investor confidence in Tesla's long-term growth prospects, which is vital for upholding the stock's high valuation multiple.

Tesla's vehicle sales for the first quarter of 2024 showed a year-over-year decline of 9%, contrasting with the Bloomberg consensus estimate which anticipated a growth of 6%, and the company-compiled consensus which expected a 5% increase. This miss represents the largest discrepancy from analyst estimates on record for the electric vehicle maker.

Previously, analysts projected that Tesla would sell 626,000 vehicles in the first quarter, marking a 48% year-over-year growth, but the actual sales reported were only 387,000 vehicles, which is 38% below the peak forecast from June 10, 2022.

In light of these results, JPMorgan has also reduced its estimates for Tesla's first-quarter revenue, now expecting $21.4 billion compared to the previous $25.6 billion, and below the consensus forecast of $23.5 billion. The firm's forecast for earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter has been lowered to $0.42 from the prior estimate of $0.69, which is also beneath the consensus of $0.61.

The revised EPS forecast is a steep drop from the peak consensus of $1.94 before Tesla implemented a strategy of heavy discounting to boost unit volume in response to softening demand.

Moreover, JPMorgan now anticipates a significant free cash outflow of $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a reversal from its earlier expectation of a $300 million inflow, and contrary to the consensus for a $1 billion inflow. This expectation is based on the assumption of a record increase in finished goods inventory, as Tesla produced 47,000 more vehicles than it sold in the quarter.

This inventory buildup, according to JPMorgan, suggests that the lower deliveries were due to demand constraints rather than supply issues, refuting any implications that disruptions such as the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea or the fire incident at Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory were the primary causes.

JPMorgan warns that Tesla shares, which already saw a 4.9% decline on Tuesday compared to the S&P 500's 0.7% drop, could face further decreases if the company fails to quickly revive unit volume and revenue growth. The firm cautions that investors might reconsider the premium valuation multiple currently assigned to Tesla's stock in the absence of sustained growth.

BYD (HKG: 1211, OTCMKTS: BYDDY) continued to dominate China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market in April, with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) dropping in its ranking.

BYD's retail sales of passenger NEVs in China totaled 254,131 units in April, giving it the No. 1 spot in the NEV market with a 37.5 percent share, according to a ranking released today by the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).

The NEV maker was the only one with a share of more than 30 percent, with retail sales up 31.1 percent year-on-year.

BYD released figures earlier this month showing it sold 313,245 NEVs in April, up 48.96 percent from a year earlier and up 3.57 percent from March. The figures are wholesale sales and include both passenger cars and commercial vehicles.

China's passenger NEVs sold 674,000 units at retail in April, up 28.3 percent from a year ago but down 5.7 percent from March, CPCA data released yesterday showed.

Tesla's retail sales in China in April were 31,421 units, down 21.4 percent from a year ago, and ranked No. 5 with a 4.6 percent share.

In the CPCA's March retail sales rankings of NEVs released last month, Tesla was No. 2 with an 8.8 percent share, behind BYD's 36.6 percent.

It's worth noting that in China, NEVs include battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel-cell vehicles. BYD produces PHEVs and BEVs, while Tesla only produces BEVs.

Tesla sold 62,167 China-made vehicles in April, including 30,746 exported, according to CPCA data released yesterday.

Tesla has a factory in Shanghai that produces the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, both for deliveries to local customers and as an export hub for it.

Tesla's pattern is to produce cars for export in the first half of the quarter and for the local market in the second half, it previously said.

Geely's retail sales of NEVs in April were up 76.3 percent at 49,155 units, placing it at No. 2 with a 7.3 percent share.

Changan Automobile's NEV retail sales in April were up 119 percent to 40,507 units, placing it 3rd with a 6 percent share.

In the January-April period, BYD's NEV retail sales were 840,137 units, up 19.6 percent year-on-year, and ranked No. 1 with a 34.3 percent share.

502,1cs3775,2024-05-14 21:06:15,Elon Musk laid off the Tesla Supercharger team; now he’s rehiring them,"Two weeks ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk enacted widespread layoffs throughout the company, including the 500-strong team responsible for the brand's Supercharger. Now, Tesla is looking to hire some of them back, Bloomberg reports, as Musk promises to spend $500 million expanding the network.

The Supercharger network is inarguably Tesla's crown jewel. The company recognized early on that, even though its owners slow-charged at home each night, knowing they had the ability to rapidly recharge on the road was critical in making an electric vehicle an acceptable alternative to existing vehicles.

Since then, it has built out more than 2,000 charging stations in the US alone, with more than 25,000 plugs. More than that, the chargers invariably work, something that is often not true for other charging networks.

So successful is the Supercharger network that, over the course of last year, virtually every other automaker that sells or plans to sell EVs in the US has announced it will drop the CCS1 connector for the J3400 standard, originally developed by Tesla. But those announcements were about more than just switching plugs. Each time, the OEM also revealed it had negotiated access for its customers to the Supercharger network.

That made Musk's dismissal of the entire team responsible so hard to fathom. While the Supercharger network accounts for only about 5 percent of Tesla's revenues, that percent is poised to grow as more OEMs gain access. And although the charging experience for Tesla EVs at Superchargers is usually flawless, that's because it's optimized for a single make of car with just five different models; there's no guarantee that will prove true when cars from other brands try to charge.

The layoffs also appeared to put Tesla's plan to build a more powerful charger that would benefit cars using 800 V or 900 V architectures, including Audi, Porsche, Lucid, and others, on hold.

Worse yet, dozens of Supercharger sites that were in the works have stalled out, according to multiple reports.

But last week, Musk announced that Tesla would spend more than $500 million building out more chargers, just days after saying the focus would instead be on uptime at existing locations. And to do that, Tesla will need to rehire a whole bunch of people.

That started with Max de Zegher, who was an executive under the previous head of Supercharging, Rebecca Tinucci. (At the time of the layoffs, Electrek reported that Musk got rid of the entire team because its Tinucci did not lay off enough workers on her own.)

This is not the first time Musk has had to back-track an impetuous business decision. In 2019, he decided to close all of Tesla's retail locations to pay for a cheaper version of the Model 3 sedan. Within two weeks that decision had been reversed, in no small part due to the legal consequences of breaking so many leases.

503,1d4w5ni,2024-05-31 13:52:58,Top proxy advisor ISS recommends against Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay package ,"Top proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday recommended Tesla shareholders vote against the re-approval of CEO Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package and withhold their support from the re-election of News Corp. scion James Murdoch to the automaker’s board.

Tesla’s shareholder meeting is on June 13.

The report, a copy of which was obtained by CNBC, comes after the other influential proxy advisor service, Glass Lewis, also recommended shareholders vote against Musk’s pay package. Tesla’s board is seeking shareholder approval to reinstate Musk’s pay after a Delaware court voided the package earlier this year.

ISS said “cautionary” shareholder support was merited for Tesla’s plans to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas, although the proxy advisor also warned that there are concerns over how Tesla’s board decided to reincorporate and over the “unknown” nature of Texas’s business law framework.

The proxy advisor recommended support for some shareholder proposals that Tesla management opposes, including one that would declassify Tesla’s board. A classified or staggered board is considered by some advisors to be an effective defense against a takeover bid.

“At a mega-cap company like Tesla, what is perhaps even more relevant to shareholders is that a staggered board can hinder shareholders from holding directors accountable for poor responsiveness,” ISS said of its support for the declassification proposal.

Pay package push

Tesla has been courting shareholder support in both time-tested and novel ways. The company engaged communications firm FGS Global and proxy solicitor Innisfree M&A to win votes, and has bolstered apparent grassroots support from its large network of social-media influencers. The company also launched a website, VoteTesla.com, and has offered shareholders the chance to win a tour of Tesla’s Gigafactory facility in Austin.

Tesla seeks shareholder approval for Musk’s payday and concurrently to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas. The company has characterized the Delaware chancery court ruling that overturned Musk’s stock package as unfriendly to shareholders, noting the value that Musk has created for investors.

“Over the last several years it has become clear that Delaware is no longer the right jurisdiction for us,” Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a letter to shareholders earlier this week.

Tesla has adopted tactics other companies have used in contested shareholder meetings, whipping votes and launching a concerted public-relations effort to win support. While Tesla is not facing any sort of meaningful organized opposition to its efforts to reincorporate or re-approve Elon’s pay package, some shareholders have come out against it. Billionaire Leo KoGuan has repeatedly said he will vote against the package. KoGuan says he owns around 0.75% of Tesla shares, worth around $4.9 billion.

Proxy advisor pull

ISS and its smaller peer Glass Lewis are an important factor in how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Their recommendations are closely watched in contested situations but are not definitive calls. Still, they have developed a reputation for being important bellwethers and seek to advocate for shareholders.

They’ve also been the direct target of Musk’s ire. Earlier this year on an earnings call, he compared ISS to the terrorist organization ISIL, also known as ISIS. Musk also said they “effectively control the stock market” on X in 2023, saying they had outsize influence over so-called “passive” or institutional shareholders.

Institutional shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard, however, do not always vote with ISS recommendations. While voting decisions are generally not disclosed until well after a shareholder meeting, those institutional shareholders have due diligence teams that help them decide how to cast the millions of shares they manage on behalf of their investors.

ISS in its report said its prior concerns over the pay package, which dates back to 2018, had not been mitigated and that it “remains excessive,” noting that “the board has effectively only offered shareholders an ‘all or nothing’ option in this vote.”

The proxy advisor alluded to Musk’s myriad other business ventures such as social media platform X, his AI startup xAI and SpaceX, as another reason why Tesla shareholders should not support the pay package.

“The grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board’s other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,” ISS said.

504,1d7wmef,2024-06-04 13:03:00,Elon Musk ordered Nvidia to ship AI chips reserved for Tesla to X and xAI ,"Elon Musk claims he can grow Tesla into “a leader in AI & robotics,” an ambition that he’s said will require a lot of pricey processors from Nvidia to build up its infrastructure.

On Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s — Nvidia’s flagship artificial intelligence chip — from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year “in combined training and inference AI.”

But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla’s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.

By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker’s receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.

“Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,” an Nvidia memo from December said. “In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.”

A more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk’s comment on the first-quarter Tesla call “conflicts with bookings” and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also “conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.” The email referenced news about Tesla’s ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an “H100 project” at Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory.

The new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital.

A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.

Critics have said Musk is only a part-time CEO of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the founder of brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022, when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup, xAI, in 2023.

X and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a post on X in November, Musk wrote, “X Corp investors will own 25% of xAI.” Additionally, xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot, called Grok, CNBC has learned.

Musk has pitched Grok, originally named Truth GPT, as a politically incorrect chatbot with “a rebellious streak” and a would-be competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative AI services.

While Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S., according to the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributed some of the slippage to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla’s stock price is down 29% this year.

Rather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla, Musk has been encouraging investors to focus on future products that he’s been promising for years but has yet to deliver. That includes AI software to turn existing cars into self-driving vehicles, dedicated robotaxis that can make money for their owners, and a driverless transportation network.

“If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,” Musk said on the April earnings call. “We will, and we are.”

To get there, he’s said, Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia’s GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Those chips are in limited supply due to soaring demand from Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and others.

‘Consuming every GPU that’s out there’

Nvidia, now the third-most-valuable company in the world with a $2.8 trillion market cap, has said it’s hard to keep up with demand. Between the cloud service providers and the companies developing AI models, customers “are consuming every GPU that’s out there,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in May, after the chipmaker reported its third straight quarter of more than 200% revenue growth.

Huang also said, on an earnings call in February, that Nvidia does its best to “allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,” adding “why allocate something when the data center’s not ready?”

In naming customers that are already using Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell platform, Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla.

Musk likes to tout his infrastructure spending at both companies.

At Tesla, Musk has promised to build a $500 million “Dojo” supercomputer in Buffalo, New York, and a “super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster” at the company’s factory in Austin, Texas. The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles.

At xAI, which is racing to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others in developing generative AI products, Musk is also seeking to build “the world’s largest GPU cluster” in North Dakota, with some capacity online in June, according to an internal Nvidia email from February.

The memo described a “Musk mandate” to make all 100,000 chips available to xAI by the end of 2024. It noted that the LLM behind xAI’s Grok was relying on Amazon and Oracle cloud infrastructure, with X providing additional data center capacity.

The Information previously reported some details of xAI’s data center ambitions.

On May 26, xAI said it closed a $6 billion financing round led by many of the same investors who funded Musk’s Twitter takeover. The company was incorporated in March 2023, but Tesla didn’t disclose its formation at the time, and it was four months later before Musk publicly introduced the startup.

Conflicts of interest

While Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI, he wrote in a post on X in January that he’d want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction.

“I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” he said in the post.

Tesla’s latest proxy filing indicates Musk has 20.5% of the company’s outstanding shares, a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. A Delaware court has ordered that compensation to be rescinded. Post-trial proceedings are ongoing and subject to appeal.

If he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark, Musk said in the January post, he “would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” He’s already doing that at xAI.

Musk’s comments at the time rankled some longstanding bulls, including the company’s largest retail shareholder, Leo Koguan, and Gerber Kawasaki’s Ross Gerber, who characterized his demand as “blackmail.”

Joel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent.

“When you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies, the law recognizes this creates conflict,” Fleming said. “If you owe fiduciary duties to two or more companies that are competing over the same things, you may end up channeling corporate opportunity away from one company to another.”

Fleming, who frequently represents public company investors in shareholder disputes, said that in such situations, other executives would be in the best position to make decisions, while those who are conflicted should abstain.

“That has not historically been the path that Mr. Musk has chosen for himself,” Fleming said.

Musk hasn’t been shy about intermingling corporate resources among his companies.

For example, following his buyout of Twitter, Musk enlisted dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. Some employees even work for two Musk companies at once.

At xAI, Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup.

A former Tesla supply chain analyst, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters, told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, where he was chairman and a top shareholder.

However, the person said, redirecting a large shipment of chips from Tesla to X is extreme, given the scarcity of Nvidia’s technology. The decision means the automaker willingly gave up precious time that could have been used to build out its supercomputer cluster in Texas or New York and advance the models behind its self-driving software and robotics.

Elon Musk’s EV maker cut the starting price of the revamped Model 3 in China by 14,000 yuan ($1,930) to 231,900 yuan, its official website showed on Sunday.

Tesla made similar cuts to the Model Y starting price, now 249,900 yuan, the regular version of the Model S to 684,900 yuan and the Model S Plaid to 814,900 yuan. The regular Model X now costs 724,900 yuan and its plaid variant 824,900 yuan.

The carmaker on Friday cut U.S. prices of its Model Y, Model X and Model S vehicles by $2,000. On Saturday it slashed the price of its Full Self-Driving driver assistant software to $8,000 from $12,000 in the United States.

Tesla reported this month that its global vehicle deliveries in the first quarter fell for the first time in nearly four years, as price cuts failed to stir demand.

The EV maker has been slow to refresh its ageing models as high interest rates have sapped consumer appetite for big-ticket items, while rivals in China, the world’s largest auto market, are rolling out cheaper models.

Musk postponed a planned trip this weekend to India, where he was to have met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing obligations at Tesla. The trip was to have included the announcement of plans for Tesla to enter the South Asian market, Reuters has reported on Saturday.

Musk said last Monday that Tesla will lay off more than 10% of its global workforce as the automaker is bracing for its first annual drop in deliveries.

The announcement came after Reuters reported on April 5 that Tesla had scrapped its plan to develop its long-awaited affordable EV in favour of robotaxis. Musk posted that “Reuters is lying” after the report, without citing any inaccuracies. He has not spoken further about the model, leaving investors clamouring for clarity.

Tesla shares fell 40.8% so far this year.

Since late 2022, Tesla ignited a price war as Musk pursued volume growth at the expense of margins.

""Look, I don't want to give away much more than what I've said publicly, except that the Roadster will be a collaboration between SpaceX and Tesla—so you can expect some rocket-y stuff there,"" he said.*  
*Asked by Lemon if it could be a flying car, Musk responded: ""Maybe,"" before waggling his head and laughing. ""It's not out of the question. I've got to reserve the cool stuff for when we actually unveil it, but it's going to be really cool; it's going to have some rocket technology in it.""*

*He added: ""I think, really, the only way to do something that's cooler than the Cybertruck is to combine SpaceX and Tesla technology to create something that's not ever really a car.""*

*""Then what would it be?"" Lemon asked.*

*""Something that's never existed before,"" Musk said, before agreeing with Lemon that it would have ""Jetsons vibes,"" a reference to the space age Hanna-Barbera cartoon which features flying cars.*

***The Context***:

*Tesla would not be the first company to attempt to build a commercially viable flying car. Several start-ups have been making use of advances in electric vehicle technology in recent years to design vehicles that hope to live up to science fiction.*

*Most recently, San Mateo, California-based start-up Alef previously told Newsweek its prototype—which received Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) approval for testing last year, and operates using a hollow body and internal rotors—was in the works. The company said pre-orders for the $300,000 vehicle had surged since the start of 2023.*

*However, no company has so far been able to secure regulatory approval for a flying road car, which would come with safety requirements and considerations that ground-based vehicles do not have to meet. For Tesla to bring a flying car to market, it would need FAA certification under the agency's adapted regulatory framework.""*

***What We Know***:

*Musk has previously teased the collaboration between his two companies in a June 2018 post on X, formerly Twitter—a platform which he now also owns.*

*At the time, he said the electric sports car would have a SpaceX-designed optional package that would include around ""10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around \[the\] car"" that would ""dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking & cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly...""*

*In 2019, he wrote that the new model would be able to go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 2.1 seconds ""before adding \[the\] rocket thruster option.""*

*Then late last month, Musk wrote on X that he had ""radically increased the design goals for the new Tesla Roadster,"" adding: ""There will never be another car like this, if you could even call it a car.""*

508,1fy93q7,2024-10-07 14:33:26,Robotaxis are here and the public is divided. Alphabet owned Waymo is the leader in the space. Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi launch.,"Driverless cars are speeding onto America’s streets, but whether the public will trust robotaxis remains an open question. 

Nearly two-thirds of Americans said they would not want to ride in a driverless passenger vehicle if they had the opportunity, according to a Pew Research Center Survey. That’s because residents in cities that have yet to experience robotaxis remain unfamiliar with the technology while those in cities with driverless cabs have not yet forgotten about high-profile accidents involving other companies, like GM-owned Cruise. 

Now Tesla, the loudest and most bullish self-driving proponent of them all, is due to unveil its long-awaited robotaxi after years of unfulfilled promises.

The company’s existing autonomous driving technology, where a human is still at the wheel, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and multiple lawsuits after hundreds of crashes. Experts say a great presentation from CEO Elon Musk won’t guarantee a safe robotaxi network.

Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi launch threatens to throw the whole autonomous vehicle space off course. 

Alphabet-owned Waymo is the leader in the space, with the company claiming it has notched more than 22 million driverless miles. It has proven that there is strong consumer demand, with weekly paid rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin doubling in just a couple months. And Waymo has worked on building its reputation, launching an online safety hub with data arguing that its cars are safer than human drivers.

Besides Tesla, other competitors are also looking to jump into the race.

Amazon says it is getting ready to roll out its fleet of Zoox cars, and Cruise is resuming operations after a 2023 accident led regulators to ground the fleet. Wall Street is already looking ahead to a driverless future, with one analyst arguing that if it hadn’t been for generative AI, 2024 would have been the year of the robotaxi. 

As driverless networks scale, one of the fiercest debates is whether ride-sharing will survive. Robotaxis may cause consumers to question if they really want to book an Uber or Lyft and talk to a stranger, sit in someone else’s car and tip a human if there is a driverless alternative. Uber has hedged its bets by inking high-profile deals with autonomous vehicle companies, but it’s unclear how long those partnerships will last.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fy93q7/robotaxis_are_here_and_the_public_is_divided/

511,1fqk8k6,2024-09-27 10:04:39,'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”

  
According to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.



In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30

512,1hfepl7,2024-12-16 08:30:16,Tesla Bull and Bear case: the great AI and liability gamble,"Tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently, nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump’s victory and Elon Musk’s instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon’s influence to relax regulations, clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout—a potential game-changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole.

Tesla is trading like an AI startup, and for good reason: its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look.  


# The Bull Case: Tesla’s data volume

Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla’s fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a “shadow trainer” for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.

Behind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases—rare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla’s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla’s vision-only approach—using cameras without lidar—makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.





# The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality

More data is not always better, and it’s possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.  The result is a more diverse dataset that’s constantly evolving.

Waymo is owned by Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.  Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.  Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.  But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.  This means that its data is much richer in quality.  The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla’s suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.

The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn’t just an incremental step—it’s an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.

Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments—places like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla’s FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.

As the saying goes, “If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.” If Waymo’s AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it’s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla’s suburban data might create a “same-shit-different-day” scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.

# Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword

If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla’s liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.  Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.

Tesla’s data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics—which is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it's a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.

# The scalability myth

Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo’s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn’t hold weight for two reasons.  First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla’s camera-only system.  Ironically, Elon’s first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn’t mean it has to be that way.  Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.  When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?  Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.



# Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google

Waymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It’s AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo’s superior compute power (via Google’s custom TPUs) means it’s clearly dominant in this regard.

Tesla bulls often cite Elon’s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla’s superior approach. But they overlook Google’s hegemony in AI.  They were in the game before anyone.  They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla’s Dojo may be promising, but it’s still a newbie.  
  


# tl;dr

Tesla’s $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.  If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality, liability risks, and Waymo’s technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind.  In which case, it's vastly overvalued.  


Full disclosure: I'm currently short the stock. That could change if the price goes down.

513,1b3kl34,2024-03-01 03:45:26,"Tesla stands to earn billions by opening U.S. chargers to drivers of Ford, other EVs","As of Thursday, owners of Ford electric vehicles — the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning — in North America finally have the ability to power up using Tesla Superchargers.

Ford CEO Jim Farley wrote in a post on LinkedIn that the charging partnership, which involves use of fast-charging adapters, should “improve the EV ownership experience,” for Ford EV drivers, noting that “I’ve tested it myself and its works great.”

Tesla has forged a similar agreement with General Motors, which was announced in June, giving GM customers access to more than 12,000 Tesla fast chargers in the U.S and Canada. GM CEO Mary Barra said at the time that her company expected to save up to $400 million of a planned investment in building out EV charging stations.

The partnerships mark a strategy shift for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who for years touted the exclusivity of Tesla’s charging network and his company’s ability to build reliable charging locations that would keep consumers from sitting in long lines. Becoming the charging standard has required Tesla to invest heavily in technical and business development.

But Tesla has plenty to gain from working with others.

Sam Fiorani, vice president for global forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said these efforts should eventually yield huge financial benefits for Tesla, including from environmental credits and fees for charging sessions.

Currently, Tesla operates about one in three charging stations in the U.S. Even if adoption of battery electric vehicles slows domestically, and the fleet of electric vehicles is smaller than what the government and many automakers planned six months ago, “Tesla could still see $6 billion to $12 billion a year,” by 2030 from its expanded charging business, Fiorani said in an email.

While Tesla could lose some customers to other brands by making charging easier, AutoForecast said there are other reasons car buyers flock to Tesla.

“People shopping for a Tesla aren’t typically cross-shopping at Kia, Ford, or Mercedes-Benz dealers because they simply want a Tesla,” Fiorani wrote. “Competition will continue to heat up and Tesla will inevitably lose some sales to rivals, but loyalty to the brand means the vast majority of owners will return to Tesla with little or no comparison shopping.”

Allowing other automakers to tap its charging network also opens up some federal money for Tesla under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

“Tesla is not afraid to use government regulations for income and has been working all possible revenue streams for much of its existence,” Fiorani wrote.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for further information.

Tesla reports charging revenue with its “Total automotive & services and other segment revenue.” The company hasn’t said whether it may break out revenue from non-Tesla vehicle use of its charging network.

William Navarro Jameson, Tesla’s Strategic Charging Programs lead, wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Thursday that getting to this point with Ford has required a lot of “interoperability testing” along with creating all the necessary hardware and software integrations and working through legal issues.

“There have been so many pieces to this puzzle that have been put in place over the past 18 months,” he wrote.

On social media, Tesla touted the opening up of its charging network in North America and circulated a link to entice more retailers to host Superchargers at their facilities.

514,1ce2p7z,2024-04-27 01:43:10,Tesla Autopilot has 'critical safety gap' linked to hundreds of collisions: NHTSA,"Federal authorities say a “critical safety gap” in Tesla’s Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 collisions, 13 resulting in fatalities and “many others” resulting in serious injuries.

The findings come from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration analysis of 956 crashes in which Tesla Autopilot was thought to have been in use. The results of the nearly three-year investigation were published Friday.

Tesla’s Autopilot design has “led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes,” the NHTSA report said. The system did not “sufficiently ensure driver attention and appropriate use.”

NHTSA’s filing pointed to a “weak driver engagement system,” and Autopilot that stays switched on even when a driver isn’t paying adequate attention to the road or the driving task. The driver engagement system includes various prompts, including “nags” or chimes, that tell drivers to pay attention and keep their hands on the wheel, as well as in-cabin cameras that can detect when a driver is not looking at the road. 

The agency also said it was opening a new probe into the effectiveness of a software update Tesla previously issued as part of a recall in December. That update was meant to fix Autopilot defects that NHTSA identified as part of this same investigation.

The voluntary recall via an over-the-air software update covered 2 million Tesla vehicles in the U.S., and was supposed to specifically improve driver monitoring systems in Teslas equipped with Autopilot.

NHTSA suggested in its report Friday that the software update was probably inadequate, since more crashes linked to Autopilot continue to be reported.

In one recent example, a Tesla driver in Snohomish County, Washington, struck and killed a motorcyclist on April 19, according to records obtained by CNBC and NBC News. The driver told police he was using Autopilot at the time of the collision.

The NHTSA findings are the most recent in a series of regulator and watchdog reports that have questioned the safety of Tesla’s Autopilot technology, which the company has promoted as a key differentiator from other car companies.

On its website, Tesla says Autopilot is designed to reduce driver “workload” through advanced cruise control and automatic steering technology.

Tesla has not issued a response to Friday’s NHTSA report and did not respond to a request for comment sent to Tesla’s press inbox, investor relations team and to the company’s vice president of vehicle engineering, Lars Moravy.

Following the release of the NHTSA report, Sens. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., issued a statement calling on federal regulators to require Tesla to restrict its Autopilot feature “to the roads it was designed for.”

On its Owner’s Manual website, Tesla warns drivers not to operate the Autosteer function of Autopilot “in areas where bicyclists or pedestrians may be present,” among a host of other warnings.

“We urge the agency to take all necessary actions to prevent these vehicles from endangering lives,” the senators said.  

Earlier this month, Tesla settled a lawsuit from the family of Walter Huang, an Apple engineer and father of two, who died in a crash when his Tesla Model X with Autopilot features switched on hit a highway barrier. Tesla has sought to seal from public view the terms of the settlement.

In the face of these events, Tesla and CEO Elon Musk signaled this week that they are betting the company’s future on autonomous driving.

“If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,” Musk said on Tesla’s earnings call Tuesday. He added, “We will, and we are.”

Musk has for years promised customers and shareholders that Tesla would be able to turn its existing cars into self-driving vehicles with a software update. However, the company offers only driver assistance systems and has not produced self-driving vehicles to date.

He has also made safety claims about Tesla’s driver assistance systems without allowing third-party review of the company’s data.

For example, in 2021, Elon Musk claimed in a post on social media, “Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.”

Philip Koopman, an automotive safety researcher and Carnegie Mellon University associate professor of computer engineering, said he views Tesla’s marketing and claims as “autonowashing.” He also said in response to NHTSA’s report that he hopes Tesla will take the agency’s concerns seriously moving forward.

“People are dying due to misplaced confidence in Tesla Autopilot capabilities. Even simple steps could improve safety,” Koopman said. “Tesla could automatically restrict Autopilot use to intended roads based on map data already in the vehicle. Tesla could improve monitoring so drivers can’t routinely become absorbed in their cellphones while Autopilot is in use.”

517,1g221z2,2024-10-12 15:03:00,"Ride-sharing giants Uber, Lyft jump after Tesla’s ‘toothless taxi’ fails to excite investors","Tesla’s hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber’s ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.

Uber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday’s event — particularly slumping in early August and mid-September — but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&P 500 higher during the session.

That is a massive turnaround for Uber’s stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla’s shares are plunging during Friday’s trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.

The buzz around Tesla’s highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company’s failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.

“TSLA’s toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,” Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.

519,1cbe0bw,2024-04-23 19:49:08,"Tesla cutting around 2,700 jobs in Austin as part of broad restructuring","Tesla is eliminating around 12% of its workforce at a factory in Austin, Texas, as part of a broader restructuring the company announced last week.

According to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act letter on Tuesday, the layoffs affect 2,688 employees at the facility in Travis County. In 2021, Tesla CEO Elon Musk moved the company’s corporate headquarters to Austin from Palo Alto, California.

Musk said in an internal memo last week that Tesla was cutting more than 10% of its global headcount as the electric vehicle maker reckons with flagging sales and increased competition. He did not say which departments or locations would be most affected.

“As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,” he wrote. A subsequent WARN notice filed in New York indicated that 285 positions were being eliminated at a factory in Buffalo.

Tesla employed 140,473 people as of December, according to filings.

Tesla officially opened its Texas EV and battery factory in April 2022, with a “cyber rodeo” party. The company now manufactures some of its Model Y crossover utility vehicles in Austin, and has started to build its Cybertruck there.

Musk later called the Austin factory, and another assembly plant in Germany, “gigantic money furnaces,” in an interview with Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, a fan club that promotes Tesla vehicles.

According to filings with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, Tesla was planning to spend upward of $770 million last year on the construction of expanded facilities in Austin, including for battery cell testing and manufacturing, cathode and drive unit manufacturing, plus a die shop, among other things.

Tuesday’s WARN filing said, “none of the employees are represented by a union and none of the employees have bumping rights,” or the right of more senior workers to replace those with less seniority.

Where do you see Tesla's stock landing?*

***This is from*** ***CNBC Pro.....***

***Key Takeaway:***

*\*JPMorgan cuts Tesla's price target to $130, predicting a 30% drop due to profit concerns and high valuation at 56 times 2024 consensus earnings.*

*\*Despite a 20% increase in vehicle volume, Tesla's Q4 automotive revenue grew only by 1%, indicating price cuts aren't boosting revenue significantly.*

*\*Tesla's operating profit forecast for this year is now $11.4 billion, down from an October estimate of $28.5 billion, yet share prices remain similar.*

***JPMorgan Lowers Price Target for Tesla:***

*JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman cuts the stock price target for Tesla by about 4% to $130, implying a 30% downside from Thursday’s close of $182.63. The reduction follows softer than expected earnings and a warning from Tesla that vehicle volume growth ""may be notably lower"" this year. Despite these warnings, Tesla's stock closed down only 12%, suggesting further downside potential according to Brinkman.*

***Falling Profits and Valuation Concerns:***

*Tesla's strategy of slashing vehicle prices has not translated into higher revenue, with actual automotive revenue growing by only 1% despite a 20% increase in vehicle volume in the fourth quarter. Analysts have substantially lowered profit expectations for Tesla since October 2022, with operating profit forecasted at $11.4 billion compared to the previous estimate of $28.5 billion for 2024.*

*Brinkman rates Tesla as underweight due to above-average execution risk and valuation concerns that seem to be pricing in significant upside related to expansion into mass-market segments beyond their volume forecasts for the Model 3.*

***STREET VIEWS***

*Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan Analyst (Bearish on Tesla):*

*""Tesla profit expectations have fallen, but even after Thursday's sell-off, the stock to us seems in comparison to have hardly noticed, suggesting plenty of further downside potential."" ""Tesla did not trade profits for sales as measured in revenue — it has traded profits for sales as measured in unit volume."" ""Although both technology and execution risk seem substantially less than was once feared, expansion into higher volume segments with lower price points seems fraught with greater risk relative to demand, execution, and competition.""*

Revenue and income has been declining YoY for two consequtive quarters now. Vehicle deliveries declining. Their market is getting eaten away by competitors and they have no strategy to combat that. Reliability (a proxy for product quality) is mid-tier. Their R&D projects are missing schedules for a while, and has no substance. 

Even though there aren't much positive indicators around the stock for a while now, why do they have such a high P/E ratio (60 as of this post)? What is the justification?

A typical response may be ""because Elon is a good liar"" or some anti-Elon emotional take, but I refuse to believe that such a superficial factor can support such a high P/E ratio. The average P/E ratio of other top car manufacturers is around 18. I can believe it if the Elon factor pushes it up to around 30, but 60 is just ridiculous.

> Elon Musk’s net worth has reached $400 billion, according to Bloomberg, making him the first person ever to cross that mark. Behind his nearly $20 billion jump in wealth was a deal that shot up Musk’s rocket company SpaceX’s valuation to roughly $350 billion, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. SpaceX and its investors agreed to purchase as much as $1.25 billion of insider shares. Tesla shares closed at a record high on Wednesday, hitting $424.77 at market close. Musk, who is Tesla’s largest individual shareholder, has also enjoyed the stock propelling higher in part due to the broader market — NASDAQ topped 20,000 for the first time ever Wednesday. Since Election Day, the EV maker’s stock has rallied roughly 65% on investors’ belief that Musk’s influence in the Trump administration will usher in an era of deregulation that will benefit the company.

The world’s wealthiest man is now roughly $136 billion richer since November 5, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While the top spots on the billionaires index typically switch around, Musk is racing past his wealthy peers. As of December 10, before his wealth skyrocketed to $400 billion, he was already $140 billion richer than the second-richest man on Earth, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

526,1b9p8eb,2024-03-08 14:27:42,Novo Nordisk market cap surpasses Tesla on new obesity pill trial data,"Wegovy obesity drug maker Novo Nordisk surpassed Tesla in market value, after fresh early trial data showed positive results for its new experimental weight loss pill.

Shares of the Danish company hit a record high on Thursday, rallying by as much as 8%, after telling investors that a Phase I trial of the company’s amycretin pill showed 13.1% weight loss in participants after 12 weeks.

Novo Nordisk is now the 12th most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $604 billion — ahead of Tesla’s $569 billion, according to FactSet data.

Shares were trading slightly lower on Friday, down 0.5%, by 10:00 a.m. London time.

The uptick of Thursday extends a months-long rally for Novo Nordisk, as excitement grows around weight loss drugs and their potential wider applications. The company is now the most valuable in Europe, with a valuation larger than Denmark’s total gross domestic product last year.

The early amycretin data marks a fresh milestone for Novo Nordisk, potentially offering a more effective and less intrusive alternative to its already widely successful injection-based Wegovy and Ozempic drugs. Wegovy showed weight loss of 6% in a 12-week trial, while Ozempic is a diabetes treatment.

A Phase II trial of amycretin will begin in the second half of this year, with results expected in early 2026, the company said Thursday. The treatment will then be subject to Phase III and Phase IV trials — a process which could take years.

Still Novo’s head of development Martin Holst Lange said Friday that he anticipated that the pill could be available to consumers “within this decade.”

“I never commit to timelines but I would be very comfortable to say at the very least within this decade,” Lange he said, according to Reuters.

The company also said that it expects amycretin, and its other new experimental obesity drug CagriSema, to have similar cardiac benefits to Wegovy.

Earlier on Thursday, Novo Nordisk said that it was expanding its focus to include cardiovascular disease treatments, as it seeks to position its offering as more than a “vanity” drug.

A large late-stage study on Tuesday showed that Ozempic delayed progression of chronic kidney disease in diabetes patients, reducing the risk of death from that and major cardiac events by 24%.

It follows previous studies demonstrating that Wegovy lowered the risk of serious cardiovascular complications in people with obesity and heart disease.

Investors have been closely watching the progression of obesity treatments and the underlying appetite-suppressing GLP-1 drug class, for an indication of their wider market implications.

Ahead of the latest developments, Barclays forecast in 2023 that the weight loss drug industry could be worth as much as $200 billion by the end of the decade, with its applications likely to disrupt sectors well beyond health care.

527,1dm0ejw,2024-06-22 17:09:26,Tesla internal data shows company has slashed at least 14% of workforce this year ,"Tesla’s hefty downsizing since 2023 has reduced its global head count to just over 121,000 people, including temporary workers, internal records suggest, indicating that the automaker has slashed more than 14% of its workforce so far this year.

The latest figure is not from precise payroll data, but from the number of people who are on Tesla’s “everybody” email distribution list as of June 17, a tally viewed by CNBC.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent an email to “everybody” that day. He told employees, “Over the next few weeks, Tesla will be doing a comprehensive review to provide stock options grants for exceptional performance.” He added that options grants will also be awarded to “anyone who does something outstanding for the company.” Tesla’s plan to reinstitute options grants, after previously pausing performance-based equity awards, was reported first by Reuters.

Tesla’s layoffs announcement landed in April, when Musk sent out a companywide email telling employees that the automaker would be cutting more than 10% of its staff. Layoffs at that point were already underway.

Bloomberg reported that Musk was aiming for a 20% staff cut. Musk indicated that the number could be even bigger. On the company’s first-quarter earnings call later in April, he said Tesla had reached an inefficiency level of 25% to 30% after “a long period of prosperity” that began in 2019.

“We’ve made some corrections along the way,” Musk said on the call. “But it is time to reorganize the company for the next phase of growth.”

In a filing for the fourth quarter, Tesla said its employee head count worldwide at the end of December was 140,473, a number that represents salaried and hourly staffers. The “everybody” email list includes temporary workers. At around 121,000, that suggests Tesla has reduced overall headcount by at least 14% since the end of 2023.

Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

In at least one instance, Musk’s head-count reductions went too far. Tesla dismantled its Supercharging team, which consisted of hundreds of employees, including its leader, Rebecca Tinucci. The company later hired some of those people back, according to posts on LinkedIn.

The broader cuts coincide with a slippage in sales at Tesla as the company reckons with an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China as well as brand deterioration that a recent survey attributed partly to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.” For the first quarter, Tesla reported a 9% drop in annual revenue, the biggest decline since 2012.

Across the auto industry, EV sales growth slowed this year after two years of rapid expansion. The slide was particularly acute for Tesla, whose Model Y was the top-selling car worldwide in 2023.

A Tesla employee, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive internal issues, told CNBC that some factory workers are fearful more layoffs could follow in July, depending on second-quarter results.

A production and deliveries report for the second quarter is expected from Tesla during the first week of July.

Musk has promised investors the company will soon publish a new “Master Plan,” which would be his fourth, and that Tesla will reveal its design for a “dedicated robotaxi” on Aug. 8.

Tesla shares were little changed on Friday at $181.71. The stock is down 27% this year, while the Nasdaq is up 18%.

528,1cdi9zv,2024-04-26 10:50:25,Tesla's shady Q1 results (real GAAP EPS at $0.12 or 65% below reported EPS),"**Deferred FSD Revenue Recognition May Have Boosted Q1 Profits Significantly**

Tesla’s Q1 revenues missed by 2.3% and non-GAAP EPS was 8.2% below estimates (see Figure 3). This was not as bad as had been feared and the stock ripped upwards by 13.3% in after-hours trading.

Despite continued price cuts, a one-month shutdown of production at their German factory, and 20% lower deliveries than in Q4 2023, Tesla somehow managed to eke out roughly flat Automotive gross margins of 18.5% in Q1 versus 18.9% in Q4 2023. Imagine having flat gross margins despite 20% lower volumes and roughly 5% lower prices.

This sounded alarm bells in my head and it turns out to be the biggest takeaway from the Q1 results: deferred FSD revenue recognition must have been huge. While Tesla noted in their Shareholder Deck that they recognized deferred FSD revenues in Q1, they did not provide a number and none of the analysts on the earnings call asked about it.

A few facts about Tesla’s FSD deferred revenue recognition:

* Deferred FSD revenue recognition is only disclosed in Tesla’s 10-Qs and they are booked within Automotive Revenues. This means we won’t know the amount booked in Q1 until next week when the 10-Q is released.
* Contribution to profits is substantial as these revenues have nearly 100% profit margins. They also boost average revenue/unit calculations unless stripped out.
* Only the full-year numbers are audited.
* Deferred revenues are a non-cash item so do not impact cash flows.
* Tesla clearly uses these deferred revenues to prop up profits during weak quarters. Figure 1 shows that the highest bookings (highlighted in red) were made during the weakest quarters of the past 3 years.

529,1f1hou9,2024-08-26 06:44:24,Morgan Stanley is cutting its position in Tesla stock. Here's why,"It seems that Morgan Stanley has finally seen the writing on the wall.

Morgan Stanley said it is slashing its position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, citing a “continued slowdown in the auto industry, intense competition among electric vehicles (EVs) and reduced consumer preferences” for EVs.

TSLA has been a part of Morgan Stanley’s model portfolio since March 2021, with the position increased in both September and December 2022. However, the stock was reduced in November 2023.

Since the last stake boost in December 2022, Tesla has delivered a 15% return, trailing the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG) by 46%, Morgan Stanley strategists highlighted.

“While we continue to hold a position in TSLA, due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets, we see an attractive opportunity to reallocate some of the position to other, less-volatile stocks that are not as economically sensitive and may have less pricing pressure,” they wrote.

Despite Tesla’s status as the leading electric vehicle company in the U.S., with potential growth avenues in robotics, AI, and energy storage, the strategists have decided to reduce the position to make room for stocks with higher earnings viability such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).

Earlier this week, the European Union announced that it would reduce planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles imported from China, lowering them from 20.8% to 9%. The EU is also cutting planned import duties for several other electric vehicle manufacturers.

These new tariffs will be in addition to the existing 10% duties already imposed by the EU on battery electric vehicle imports.

In June, the EU indicated it would impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, arguing that these vehicles ""heavily benefit from unfair subsidies"" and present a ""threat of economic injury"" to European EV producers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f1hou9/morgan_stanley_is_cutting_its_position_in_tesla/

While there’s no direct tension yet, some news outlets have sarcastically referred to Musk as an 'unelected figure' eager to steal the spotlight, suggesting that his high-profile actions might overshadow others.

This raises the question: Is Tesla’s current rally driven by the perceived good relationship between Musk and Trump, or is it rooted in a genuine improvement in Tesla’s revenue outlook? If the rally is supported by a stronger business foundation, this speculative angle may hold little weight. Conversely, if public perception and narratives are the primary drivers, the risk of a fallout could present a case for downside potential.

For disclosure, while I am currently long on Tesla, my holdings are relatively small. Nevertheless, I believe this thesis deserves further exploration for those considering speculative positions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hhrgms/question_on_tesla_could_a_potential_fallout/

535,1ewsihm,2024-08-20 10:54:37,"European Union slashes planned tariffs on China-made Tesla EVs, other Chinese firms ","The European Union on Tuesday said planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles being imported from China would be cut to 9% from 20.8%, while also reducing a number of planned import duties on other Chinese electric vehicle firms.

In June, the EU said it would slap higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, which it found benefit “heavily from unfair subsidies” and pose a “threat of economic injury” to EV producers in Europe.

The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, announced a preliminary conclusion that the battery-electric vehicles value chain in China “benefits from unfair subsidisation” and pronounced that it is in the EU’s interest to impose “provisional countervailing duties” on BEV imports from China.

536,1ez0u00,2024-08-23 01:49:11,"Roadside Tesla Semi fire where temperatures reached 1,000 degrees draws in NTSB investigative team","A crash and large fire along a California freeway involving an electric Tesla Semi has drawn the attention of federal safety investigators.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it’s sending a team of investigators from the Office of Highway Safety mainly to look into fire risks posed by lithium-ion batteries.

The team will work with the California Highway Patrol to “examine the wreckage and gather details about the events leading up to the collision and the subsequent fire response,” the agency said in a statement.

The Los Angeles Times reported that the Tesla rig was traveling east on Interstate 80 around 3:15 a.m. Monday near Emigrant Gap, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northeast of Sacramento, when it went off the road and collided with trees near the right shoulder.

The battery caught fire, spewing toxic fumes and reaching a temperature of 1,000 degrees, forcing firefighters to wait for it to burn out, the Highway Patrol told the newspaper. The Tesla driver walked away from the crash and was taken to a hospital, and the freeway was temporarily closed.

The battery burned into the late afternoon while firefighters tried to cool it down for cleanup, and the freeway didn’t reopen until 7:20 p.m., authorities said.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the crash and fire from Tesla.

After an investigation that ended in 2021 the NTSB determined that high-voltage electric vehicle battery fires pose risks to first responders and that guidelines from manufacturers about how to deal with them were inadequate.

The agency, which has no enforcement powers and can only make recommendations, called for manufacturers to write vehicle-specific response guides for fighting battery fires and limiting chemical thermal runaway and reignition. The guidelines also should include information on how to safely store vehicles with damaged lithium-ion batteries, the agency said.

Tesla began delivering the electric Semis in December of 2022, more than three years after CEO Elon Musk said his company would start making the trucks. Musk has said the Semi has a range per charge of 500 miles (800 kilometers) when pulling an 82,000-pound (37,000-kilo) load.

539,1cvelzm,2024-05-19 03:10:31,"As Tesla layoffs continue, here are 600 jobs the company cut in California ","As part of Tesla’s massive restructuring, the electric-vehicle maker notified the California Employment Development Department this week that it’s cutting approximately 600 more employees at its manufacturing facilities and engineering offices between Fremont and Palo Alto.

The latest round of layoffs eliminated roles across the board — from entry-level positions to directors — and hit an array of departments, impacting factory workers, software developers and robotics engineers.

The cuts were reported in a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, Act filing that CNBC obtained through a public records request.

Facing both weakening demand for Tesla electric vehicles and increased competition, the company has been slashing its headcount since at least January. CEO Elon Musk told employees in a memo in April that the company would cut more than 10% of its global workforce, which totaled 140,473 employees at the end of 2023.

Previous filings revealed that Tesla would cut more than 6,300 jobs across California; Austin, Texas; and Buffalo, New York.

Musk said on Tesla’s quarterly earnings call on April 23 that the company had built up a 25% to 30% “inefficiency” over the past several years, implying the layoffs underway could impact tens of thousands more employees than the 10% number would suggest.

According to the WARN filing, the 378 job cuts in Fremont, home to Tesla’s first U.S. manufacturing plant, included people involved in staffing and running vehicle assembly. There were 65 cuts at the company’s Kato Rd. battery development center.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Among the highest-level roles eliminated in Fremont were two environmental health and safety directors, and a user experience design director.

In Palo Alto, home to the company’s engineering headquarters, 233 more employees, including two directors of technical programs, lost their jobs.

Tesla has also terminated a majority of employees involved in designing and improving apps made for customers and employees, according to two former employees directly familiar with the matter. The WARN filing shows that to be the case, with many cut from the team at Tesla’s Hanover Street location in Palo Alto.

Tesla faces reduced demand for cars it makes in Fremont, including its older Model S and X vehicles and Model 3 sedan. Total deliveries dropped in the first quarter from a year earlier, and Tesla reported its steepest year-over-year revenue decline since 2012.

An onslaught of competition, especially in China, has continued to pressure Tesla’s sales in the second quarter. Xiaomi and Nio have each launched new EV models, which undercut the price of Tesla’s most popular vehicles.

Tesla’s stock price has tumbled about 30% so far this year, while the S&P 500 is up 11%.

Musk has been trying to convince investors not to focus on vehicle sales and instead to back Tesla’s potential to finally deliver self-driving software, a robotaxi, and a “sentient” humanoid robot. Musk and Tesla have long promised customers self-driving software that would turn their existing EVs into robotaxis, but the company’s systems still require constant human supervision.

Other recent job cuts at Tesla included the team responsible for building out the Supercharger, or electric-vehicle fast-charging network, in the U.S.

Tesla disclosed plans in its annual filing for 2023 to grow and optimize its charging infrastructure “to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.” Tesla said in the filing that it needed to expand its “network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer demands,” after other auto companies announced plans to adopt the North American Charging Standard.

Since cutting most of its Supercharger team, Tesla has reportedly started to rehire at least some members, a move reminiscent of the job cuts Musk made at Twitter after he bought the company and later rebranded it as X. Musk told CNBC’s David Faber last year that he wanted to rehire some of those he let go.

541,1bhzjkj,2024-03-18 19:31:35,"Tesla shares gain after Model Y price hike in U.S., Europe","Shares of Tesla jumped nearly 7% on Monday after the automaker announced price increases for its Model Y electric vehicles across some European countries and the United States.

Tesla said prices of its Model Y vehicles will be increased by approximately 2,000 euros ($2,177) in some European countries effective March 22, according to a company statement on Saturday. It had announced on Friday price hikes for all Model Y cars in the U.S. by $1,000 effective April 1.

Tesla shares rose as high as $174.72, up nearly 7%, on Monday following the announcements, making it the biggest percent daily gain in more than a month after sliding for two weeks. The stock is now on track for its second straight day of gains after dropping to a near 10-month low last week. It was last up 6.3% at $173.92.

“In light of persistently high Model Y inventory, we view Tesla’s preview of future price increases as an attempt to boost sales this month, rather than a sign of solid demand,” said Deutsche Bank analysts led by Emmanuel Rosner in an investor note on Monday.

The median estimate of the 49 analysts currently covering Tesla’s shares is $193, down from $211.50 a month ago, and their average recommendation is “hold,” according to LSEG data.

Goldman Sachs analysts slashed their 12-month price target on Tesla’s stock to $190, down from $220, citing obstacles to its ramp in Model 3 production and a manufacturing downtime at its Berlin gigafactory following an arson attack.

Tesla’s sales will also be impacted by reduced electric vehicle subsidies in Europe, rising competition in China — which is the company’s second-largest market after the U.S. — and slowing demand, the analyst led by Mark Delaney wrote in an investor note on Sunday.

“While we continue to believe that Tesla is well positioned for longer-term growth given its strong position in the EV and clean energy markets ... we believe that softer near-term EV market conditions are weighing on earnings,” the analyst said.

543,1adgztd,2024-01-28 23:50:35,Tesla's Bull Case,"I see a lot of negative sentiment around Tesla and a true lack of understanding of what is to come.

I have been in Tesla since 2017 and this company has evolved in ways I never imagined.

I am more bullish today than I have ever been.

This is not investment advice and I honestly don't care whether you buy, sell, short, use options or anything else.

&#x200B;

People see Tesla's market cap of approximately $575 billion and immediately think it's overvalued.  They only make X amount, they only sold X amount, and Elon said/did this today.

&#x200B;

If it were as easy as looking at what a company currently is, or what they have done, everyone would be rich.  That is not how investing works.  There needs to be an understanding of what the future will look like.

&#x200B;

The future I see is one of abundance of labor, energy, time, etc.

&#x200B;

Tesla is set up to capitalize like no other company in history and become larger than anything anyone has ever built before.

&#x200B;

Lets focus on the now for a moment though.

&#x200B;

Things to understand, the company has the #1 selling vehicle in the world.  Not just #1 EV, it's the #1 car.

The TAM for there current lineup of vehicles is approaching it's cap with current interest rates and pricing.  The growth will be moderate compared to what people are use too from Tesla.

The current lineup of vehicles is printing money for them though, which is padding there balance sheet now with $29 billion in cash, about 5% of the market cap and the rest covering all of their current investments in the future and operations.

So for 2024 we can expect moderate volume growth and everyone already knows.

What will margins look like in 2024, nobody really knows, some people think it will continue to trend down, some people think it bottomed in Q3, when it bounced up slightly in Q4. Regardless I know that they will be printing more money and strengthening their balance sheet further while growing current projects.

They will also be ramping the Cybertruck as well this year, new product for which I expect in the 75k-100k range produced/delivered.

So that is vehicle outlook for 2024.

&#x200B;

What about energy which just seems like a completely overlooked aspect of the business.

They delivered over 14 gwh of energy storage in 2023, up from 6 gwh in 2022.

The Lathrop factory is scaling to produce 40 gwh annually and they have a new factory in shanghai on the books to come on later this year for an additional 40 gwh of production.

Tesla did about $3.9 billion in revenue in 2022 from energy,  around $6.4 billion 2023.

They only deployed 14 gwh of what will soon be 80 gwh of capacity and it already is starting to impact their profits positively and becoming a meaningful source of profits and revenue.

So while the vehicle business will have lower growth in 2024, the energy business will have accelerated growth.

What about batteries? Tesla is ramping their own 4680's and expects to install additional lines later this year and produce all they need for the Cybertruck ramp as well as Semi and future projects that require it.

The IRA bill that passed is going to pay Tesla for the production of these batteries.  They literally are looking to be at a production rate of 100 gwhr of 4680's annually later this year and will get paid per kwhr produced.  This amount of money that will come in is not understood yet.

So for 2024, energy is entering into a very interesting and lucrative phase.

&#x200B;

I am not really going to touch on charging much but their network of chargers continues to grow, other vehicle manufactures will gain access this year as well as all the new Tesla's produced, this is something to consider.

&#x200B;

Okay so that covers 2024, I expect earnings to be far better than people expect, especially in the latter half of the year.

&#x200B;

What about the future?

The TAM for vehicles will be expanding massively.  They already said they plan to produce their next generation vehicle in 2025 in Austin and then expand to their new factory in Mexico, and another undecided location for a factory overseas.  The #1 selling car is the Model Y at over 1.2 million sold annually.  What happens when there is a new vehicle for a fraction of the cost made by Tesla.  I don't even know if it will qualify for the POS tax credit from the IRA but if it does, the price for this car could be insane. It's already expected to be sub 25k. This thing will sell many millions and usher in that next wave of vehicle growth. The car goes into production next year, did I say that already, NEXT YEAR.

&#x200B;

Lets talk about what is probably the greatest opportunity of our lifetime, I am not even talking about FSD for autonomous vehicles which would revolutionize travel and the economics of it for people and the company, I am talking about Humanoid Bots.  I don't think people understand that they are coming, not just from Tesla but multiple companies and they are around the corner.  This is real, everyone is asleep right now and don't realize but this is happening.  They are going to be filling labor gaps initially, and eventually will be everywhere will Millions shipping.

&#x200B;

The economics for this type of product is hard to fathom, people do not understand and Tesla is the best positioned out of any company with their manufacturing capabilities, engineering, ai background and access to capital.

&#x200B;

So while I believe 2024 will be better than people realize thanks to stable margins from vehicles, acceleration of growth in energy, and a tam expansion coming in 2025 to lead the next wave of volume and eps growth, these things will pale in comparison to what this Bot represents and it is not priced in, nor is the next gen vehicle.

&#x200B;

Do your own DD, make your own decision, but I am ready for what is to come and will capitalize on it.

553,1dtmiqp,2024-07-02 13:59:03,When will Tesla no longer be considered “just a car company”?,"When will Tesla be not considered “just a car company? 

I’m fairly uneducated in the stock world, and I’m hoping someone can shed some light on this. I’m really hoping for genuine discussion. I’m not trying to start anything toxic. 

I commonly see online that people say Tesla is just a car company, despite their energy division and in the future potential AI income. 
 
My question is at what point is Tesla actually not just a car company anymore? I have a few ideas:

1. When they sell more of X product compared to cars.

2. When their revenue with X product is higher than car revenue

3. Will they always just be known as a car company because that’s how they started out? 

Is there any substance to Tesla even being considered not just a car company anymore? Am I totally off base here? 

I’m asking this today because their Q2 2024 deliveries came out at 444k cars delivered AND  9.4Gwh of energy deployed. If you converted the energy storage deployment to “cars” it ends up comparable to 56k additional cars. Math is below

$300/kWh, 9.4 GWh = $2.82 Billion. 
At an ASP of $50k, $2.82B/$50K = 56,400 “Cars”

This seems relatively substantial.

554,1f5ivu1,2024-08-31 08:54:12,I think Alphabet (GOOGL) is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now,"I am 100% invested in Alphabet due to several reasons. I think we are in a similar situation to Meta when it was faced with law suits, reached 90$ last year and everybody said it would die. 

1. Alphabet is growing in the double digits every year since its inception. Its PE is on the way to below 20 and laughably cheap for a tech company with that growth. 

3. They crushed earnings and the only reason for their slump afterwards was their heavy AI spending, which they can easily cut if they see its not worth it anymore. Also comparable to Meta.

2. Alphabet is a leader in innovative technologies such as autonomous driving. Tesla shot up 40% or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving, while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users. 

3. I dont think that AI will be as useful as some still expect. But in no way Google is endangered by that. I dont have more recent numbers, but in July Googles market share in the search business grew slightly, while ChatGPT declined by 12%. I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers. 

4. If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important, its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024, google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price.

5. Tech companies are literally what keeps the american economy and influence in the world right now alive. I think its not realistic to think that the DOJ will do anything which substancially weakens an american tech company at this point. They will probably get a slap on the wrist in a way of a (big) fine. But priced in is currently a potential break up.

6. Atleast for the next earnings I expect an ad revenue ""short squeeze"" because of the really polarized american election. Way more money will be invested in ads than in previous elections, and while the sum on its own isnt that much, depending on how elastic the ad market is, it will drive up ad space for everyone involved.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f5ivu1/i_think_alphabet_googl_is_the_most_undervalued/
555,1bekj4k,2024-03-14 12:56:52,Tesla (TSLA) DCF Analysis,"***NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***

# Introduction:

TSLA is the world's most renowned Electric Vehicle(EV) automaker, catalyzing the world's acceleration towards Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles. TSLA has become the gold standard for what a high-quality EV stands for, all thanks in part to their founder's vision and belief in renewable energy especially during the tumultuous early years of TSLA. TSLA no longer just stands for EV but renewable energy, having branched out into Energy Storage, and Solar Panels.  TSLA hopes to create an ecosystem for renewable energy from charging to energy storage to the vehicle used, all this tied together by dedicated software created by TSLA at every point of contact in the ecosystem. This ecosystem business model has seen massive success as evident from businesses like GOOG, AAPL, and MSFT. I believe the next frontier of growth for TSLA comes from energy storage rather than automotive, however automotive will still account for the largest chunk of revenue for TSLA.

# Market:

TSLA's closest EV competitor is BYD. TSLA has won BYD on almost every front. A country where BYD has managed to wrest control from TSLA is Thailand. So I'll analyze this market specifically to rationalize why I believe this victory will be shortlived.

In Thailand, the top 3 most popular car models are BYD Atto 3, Netta V, and BYD Dolphin ([SOURCE](https://carnewschina.com/2024/01/09/byd-is-bestselling-ev-brand-in-thailand-in-2023-neta-is-runner-up/)).   

|Model|Price|Range|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BYD Atto 3|1.1M Baht|521 km/charge|
|Neta V|0.55M Baht|380 km/charge|
|BYD Dolphin|0.75M Baht|427 km/charge|
|Tesla Model 3|1.59M Baht|513 km/charge|

In Thailand, 60.17% of the population owns a car ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027960/thailand-car-ownership-among-consumers/)) with the average car price being about 0.78M Baht. This means that a Tesla Model 3, TSLA's cheapest model is double the average price of a normal car in Thailand. 

[SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1030220/thailand-average-monthly-income-per-household-by-region/)) which means that the Tesla Model 3 is a luxury good rather than an affordable commodity for the average household. The difference in price between BYD and Tesla is a full year's worth of income for the average household which leads the price-conscious consumers in Thailand to naturally gravitate towards BYD, hence the popularity of BYD over Tesla in Thailand.   
  
Ultimately, I do believe that if TSLA continues competing on quality and finds ways to cut costs such as directly setting up factories in Thailand ([SOURCE](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/business/thailand-tesla-factory-talks-intl-hnk/index.html)), it will be able to close the price gap with BYD. As ""people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It’s quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it’s the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference

# Revenue:

TSLA has 5 revenue channels, namely “Automotive Sales”, “Services and Others”, “Automotive Lease”, “Automotive Regulatory Credit” and “Energy Generation and Storage sales”. 

***Automotive Sales***

Automotive sales refers to the direct sale of TSLA’s vehicles fully paid upfront.

Elon Musk believes that manufacturing capabilities will be the most important C.A. for TSLA. “perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

When forecasting the Number of Vehicles each Gigafactory can produce, I took into account that Elon Musk recently unveiled in the 2023 Q4 Earnings conference that there is a new revolutionary manufacturing technology that is expected to drastically improve production. He hopes to pilot test this technology at the Texas Gigafactory to produce their low-cost EV before proceeding to replicate the technology in every Gigafactory. “the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. So, in my first 3 years, I assume that the growth rate is below historical averages as TSLA tests out new technology in preparation for the launch of the low-cost EV. I assumed that TSLA’s manufacturing technology was successful.  
  
When forecasting %Vehicles delivered, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages  
  
When forecasting Avg Price/Vehicles Delivered, Elon Musk doesn’t believe in price increases to increase the topline. As evident in 2021 and 2022 where Elon Musk only increased prices due to supply chain constraints before bringing prices back down in 2023. In China, Elon Musk ended up cutting prices due to being able to source significantly cheaper batteries there. I assumed that over time as TSLA enjoys sufficient economies of scale, they will only increase prices in line with perpetual inflation.  


***Services and Others***

TSLA provides a few services such as home servicing in certain regions or customers pay to access TSLA’s network of SuperChargers.  
  
Lifetime number of TSLA automobile (Ex roadster) delivered ([SOURCE](https://backlinko.com/tesla-stats))

Assuming that TSLA is properly maintained they can last \~20 years ([SOURCE](https://caredge.com/blog/how-long-tesla-batteries-last)). Opting for less granularity, in my forecast I assumed the total lifetime number of tesla cars remained constant without any churn.

When forecasting Services and Others, Opting for less granularity I assumed that the servicing’s pricing grew following the price of the vehicle in line with historic averages. 

  
***Automotive Lease***

TSLA has 2 types of lease, “Direct Vehicle Operations Lease” which leases out vehicles to customers for up to 48 months afterwards the vehicle is returned to TSLA. “Direct Sales Lease” either granting the customer title of the vehicle once full payment has been made or the customer has the option of refusing the vehicle.  
  
When forecasting Automotive leasing, as prices for TSLA fell in 2023, Automotive leasing as a percentage of Automotive Sales dropped as it is now cheaper for customers to purchase their tesla in 1 lump sum payment. I assumed that following this trend, as TSLA’s affordability increases over time the %Automotive Sales decreases as well before remaining constant in perpetuity.

  
***Automotive Regulatory Credit***

TSLA has excess carbon credit which it sells to competitors.

“It will continue for some period of time, but eventually this stream of regulatory credits will reduce.” ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-9-billion-revenue-selling-regulatory-credits-to-other-carmakers-2024-2)).  


When forecasting Automotive Regulatory Credit, given that TSLA does not intend to depend on these credits for revenue, I assume that as a %of Automotive sales, credit will contribute to a significantly lesser amount in perpetuity. This is further exacerbated by other automobile companies accelerating their push towards EVs as countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles. So, more companies begin having excess regulatory credits as well. Ultimately, I believe that leading up to 2030 the amount of revenue contributed by Regulatory credits decreases to a significant level. 

  
***Energy Generation and Storage Sales***

TSLA produces Energy Storage systems e.g. Megapack and Solar Energy related products e.g. Solar Panels which it directly sells to customers.  
  
For energy storage more specifically megapacks, as the world phases out ICE vehicles and begins embracing renewable energy, it leads to a surge in demand for electricity. However, the issue with renewable energy is that “The most common renewable energy sources like the sun and wind are intermittent or have lower baseload capabilities than coal, natural gas, or nuclear sources. This makes it necessary to have a way to conserve excess energy produced during peak hours. This extra energy can then be supplied through the grid or otherwise when the sun is down, or wind speed reduces.” ([SOURCE](https://www.batterycycle.io/why-is-tesla-focusing-on-the-battery-energy-storage-market/)). As an example to elaborate on how much importance is placed on energy storage, China mandates that all renewable energy facilities must store at least 20% of their total output ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiYquPrkuaEAxXuSGwGHffzBkgQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ferikkobayashisolomon%2F2023%2F12%2F20%2Fenergy-vault-wins-big-with-gravity-storage-in-china%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DChina%2520has%2520mandated%2520that%2520all%2Cgeneration%2520capacity%27s%2520worth%2520of%2520storage.&usg=AOvVaw3WMq0w9-2ka0Cz2kAGbCWX&opi=89978449)).  
  
The closest competitor to TSLA in energy pack is BYD. The TSLA’s megapack is smaller in dimensions compared to BYD and on top of that TSLA has built its own software to be compatible with the megapack hardware with features such as Autobidder (Software to optimize energy trading) and Powerhub.  
  
Right now what's stopping revenue for energy storage is production capacity, TSLA opened its megapack factory in Lathrop to curb this. TSLA has also announced its plans to build a megapack factory in China to assist with production capacity ([SOURCE](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-22/tesla-acquires-land-for-shanghai-megapack-battery-factory)). As an overarching goal for my forecast, I took into account the TSLA master plan 3.  
  
When forecasting number of dedicated megapack factories opened, I assumed that TSLA would open 1 additional plant every 3 years for the next 10 years, to meet the large surge in demand as countries accelerate their push towards renewable energy.  
  
When forecasting Max Output/Factory, taking into account this article on expected output. ([SOURCE](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/11/tesla-megapack-factory-production-limit-solved-and-capacity-will-be-doubled-to-80-gwh.html)). TSLA’s Lathrop Megapack factory can produce 80GWh/Year in part due to them doubling their existing lines and resolving certain issues. Over time I believe that TSLA can massively increase the Max Output/Factory, as TSLA consistently touts their innovations as having an S curve of progression, where progress is slower at the earlier stages before exponentially increasing.   
As a sanity check, in my base case assuming that all Mega packs are still at 4 MWh. TSLA has to produce 406,200 Mega Packs or 81,240 Mega Pack per factory a year by 2038. As of November 2023, the Lathrop factory can produce 20,000 megapack. So, in 15 years I believe it is a reasonable amount of time necessary for TSLA to ramp up their production 4x.  
  
When forecasting %GWh Deployed, I had to assume total output which is a function of max output and the number of gigafatories. I assumed that over the years as more countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles in favor of EVs, there is a larger need to deploy more energy storage so this % increases to a large extent.  
  
When forecasting Avg Sales/GWh Deployed, Elon Musk does not like to increase sales through increasing pricing which was why when TSLA enjoyed economies of scale from increasing output in their Lathrop factory the Avg Sales/GWh Deployed decreased. So, applying this principle of TSLA slashing prices when costs decrease due to economies of scale, I assumed that TSLA continued slashing prices before increasing by the perpetual inflation rate.

# Cost:

“predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

  
When forecasting Automotive and Non-Automtoive COGS, COGS as a %revenue for 2021 and 2022 are likely to be lower due to TSLA pre-emptively increasing sales price to deal with inflation. However, in 2023 COGS as a %revenue increased as TSLA cut back on sales price. Going forward, I’ll assume that TSLA tends towards historic pre-covid average. However, in the long run, as TSLA successfully implements their manufacturing technology this % will decrease even further.  
When forecasting R&D, SG&A, and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# WACC:

US 10Y T-Bond (1M Avg) = 4.12%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)) = 2.41  
Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%

COD (1M Avg) = 5.72%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  
AT-COD = 4.52%

WACC = 15.12%  
  
Currently, TSLA has a very large beta as its stock has increased in volatility in the past few years. However, I believe that this volatility will not persist for very long as most big tech stocks enter a stable stage where their beta tends downwards. So, as a proxy for how low TSLA’s beta will tend to, I looked at other big tech stocks.



|Name|Beta|
|:-|:-|
|Google (GOOG)|1.04|
|Microsoft (MSFT)|0.89|
|Meta (META)|1.21|

Taking the average beta, we arrive at a beta of 1.05. Assuming similar D/E composition and bond rating. I assumed that it took another 10 years for TSLA to reach the stable state.  
  
Stable State COE = 8.95%  
Stable State AT-COD = 4.52%  
TSLA’s stable stage WACC = 8.90%  


# Conclusion:

Ultimately in my base case, I value TSLA at $186.88 per share. I believe that there is still room for TSLA to grow, having such a strong first movers advantage in the renewable energy market means that TSLA is heads and shoulders above its competitors. I believe that the market is undervaluing the Energy Storage arm of TSLA's business, and less emphasis is placed on this potentially disruptive segment of business.

556,1d9kjg0,2024-06-06 15:11:04,Why Are People Voting Yes on The Musk Compensation Plan?,"After getting smoked in the Delaware court for basically being in bed with his board and failing to properly disclose the feasibility of compensation goals, Musk and Tesla are looking to push the pay +$50 billion package through again. From my understanding the goals were as follows: $20 billion in revenue and achieve a 100 billion dollar market cap. Tesla easily achieved both, and it knew it was going to prior to the compensation package (undisclosed at the time). 300 million stock options (or 10%ish of the company) for these targets seems unreasonable. However, that's technically fine if it was negotiated fairly. It is undeniable that the board of Tesla is under Musk's control.

Taking a broader look at Tesla, It is down 30% YTD. Musk has laid off roughly 10% of its workforce. FSD is still not close to completion. Sales are down YOY. The supercharger team has been largely laid off. Musk has started a company that competes directly with Tesla. So my question is why does anyone want to vote yes on giving 10% of their company to this guy who seems to not even care about Tesla?

557,1hnwhlf,2024-12-28 03:12:44,Tesla's Genius Autonomous Strategy and Implied Supremacy,"Tesla's autonomous program FSD (Full Self-Driving) will inevitably become the prime competitor in the U.S. to Waymo, and the leader everywhere else where it is legal. I have this conviction because I can look clearly at the actual comparisons of the vehicles statistics rather than their permit level. The reason that it makes sense to ignore the permit level, is that Tesla intentionally declares their autonomous program at Level 2 Autonomy to avoid the increased regulations on testing that Level 3 or Level 4 incur. 

Essentially, what Tesla has seemingly believed from the inception of their FSD program, was that **more Data = better system**. And I agree with them. If we look at any machine learning program or deep learning that has aimed to create a high fidelity system, most of the time the **sheer scale of data has increased output quality immensely**. In deploying their FSD to independent owners who supervise it, they essentially are able to scale their data collection **without** hiring and deploying ""skilled safety testers"" like Waymo has had to in the past to collect data and train their model, giving them a huge leg up in cost efficiency and scalability. 

People don't realize how good Tesla's FSD because of Autopilot's failures. The rollout of Autopilot and the marketing of it has a lot of criticism for good reason, but Full Self-Driving may as well be a different system with how markedly different the crash rates between them are. This is also combined with the fact that **Waymo vehicles have not operated on freeways** while Tesla vehicles have. Waymo only recently began testing on freeways, which is quite insane to me because how can anyone believe that Waymo has achieved technological supremacy when they only started testing on freeways a few months ago?? 

**All of these reasons contribute to my belief that Tesla will achieve Level 5 Autonomy first**. (No Driver, no steering wheel, no pedals). Not only do they actually have a working model of the CyberCab while Waymo does not, they also now have the government aligned with them on the federal level that could provide them the ability to create regulatory guidance and permits that could benefit the public's perception and deployment of FSD. **You have all of the basic, important facts you need to see the likely outcome of the autonomous vehicle landscape, but it's up to you to cut through the noise of what news articles write about Tesla's implied supremacy here. Tesla will say it, you don't have to believe them because there's people saying otherwise, but you have all the details here and the cognitive capacity to ascertain the truth.

560,1csoh05,2024-05-15 16:04:38,"Tesla's China rival Nio launches a new brand, car cheaper than the Model Y ","Chinese electric car company Nio revealed Wednesday that the first car for its new, lower-priced brand, Onvo, will be about $4,000 cheaper than Tesla’s comparable Model Y.

Deliveries for Onvo’s first car, the L60 SUV, are set to begin in September, the company said. Pre-sales began after Wednesday’s launch event.

Nio CEO William Li said he expects Onvo to begin selling its cars overseas at some point but didn’t specify when, according to an interview with CNBC’s Eunice Yoon.

Since launching about 10 years ago, Nio has focused on the premium segment of cars, priced around 300,000 yuan (US$41,500) or higher. The company has since expanded to Europe, but its monthly deliveries in China have generally remained modest versus the competition.

Onvo’s L60 starts at 219,900 yuan ($30,439), versus the Model Y’s 249,900 yuan. Elon Musk’s electric SUV has been one of the best-selling pure battery-powered electric cars in China.

Fierce competition in China’s electric car market has invited new entrants and prompted many companies to cut prices.

Smartphone company Xiaomi in late March entered the electric car market with its SU7 sedan to rival Tesla’s Model 3 with a price that was also about $4,000 cheaper.

The Model 3 has since cut its price by about $2,000 to 231,900 yuan, according to Tesla’s China website. Xiaomi said Wednesday it had delivered 10,000 SU7 vehicles.

BYD, which sold more cars than Elon Musk’s automaker last year when including hybrids, mostly sells cars in the range of 100,000 yuan or below. BYD has started to expand into higher-price segments in the last few years.

Nio CEO Li confirmed to CNBC the L60 is using lower-priced batteries from BYD.

Global competition from Chinese EV makers has also prompted stiff new tariffs from the Biden administration on imports of the vehicles to the U.S. Chinese EVs will be subject to a 100% tariff, the administration announced earlier this week.

When asked about the new levies, Li called them “completely unreasonable,” noting the impact on consumers and climate goals. That’s according to a CNBC translation of the Mandarin.

A ‘new standard’ family car to rival Tesla

Onvo aims to set a “new standard” for the family car, Alan Ai, president of the Nio sub-brand, said at Wednesday’s launch event in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.

The brand’s name stands for “On Voyage,” while its Chinese name “Le Dao” is meant to evoke a family having a happy time together.

Ai made many comparisons to the Model Y and other cars during his presentation.

He claimed the L60′s interior was more spacious than that of Tesla’s Model Y and Toyota’s Rav4. He also showed videos that claimed Onvo’s new car had better shock absorption and cut tighter figure-eights than those of competitors.

Onvo’s advertised driving range on a single charge is at least as far as — or even further — that of the Model Y depending on the version.

As a sub-brand, Onvo vehicles can access many of Nio’s battery swap and charging stations, Ai said.

He also showed videos of Onvo models using driver-assist technology to navigate through country roads and city streets.

Tesla’s driver assist software, Full Self Driving, isn’t available in China yet but is widely expected to be nearing Beijing’s approval for rollout.

Saw many talking/writing about short squeeze, so-called analysts like Ives talking about robotaxi, others talking about energy, etc.   It's all over the place.  All trying to justify the crazy multiple expansion of this stock.  Most are convinced Tesla will achieve L3/L4/L5 autonomous classification to support robotaxi, as it has been sold to us.

ALL of them, I say again, ALL of them ignoring the fact that Tesla cars cannot achieve Level3 certification WITHOUT a backup system, such as LIDAR. Therefore, Tesla will never get L3 certified unless the US state motor vehicle regulators change the laws around this, and I highly doubt it will happen anytime soon. Equally I don't expect Tesla to start adding LIDAR since it would cut into their profit margin.  Assuming that by some miracle they actually achieve L3, L4/L5 is a huge leap forward and required for robotaxi.

I genuinely believe there is corruption that persist here.  Much cheaper to bribe other people (or encourage fan boys) to spread lies throughout the internet about the future of tesla robotaxi fantasy.  I know I sound like a consipracist.  So, someone please explain to me what is wrong with everyone, including financial professionals, promoting this Tesla robotaxi lie?

566,1gb1w72,2024-10-24 12:52:29,"Tesla’s Not a Car Company, Musk’s in the Business of Selling the Future. And 5 Other Things to Know Today.","

It may surprise some to learn that Tesla isn’t really in the car business.

Sure, some 80% of its revenue currently comes from electric vehicles. And CEO Elon Musk is pretty good at squeezing profit out of those cars—something many in the industry still haven’t managed to figure out.

But the most important thing to know about the company is that it trades on more than 70 times forward earnings. Ford and General Motors are on five or six times. This suggests that when investors buy Tesla stock, their expectations are in a different universe from when they buy into other car makers.

Musk is pulling old-school levers to ensure his cars are profitable, even as rivals churn out lower-cost models. It helps that Tesla can now make more vehicles from the same manufacturing base and squeeze suppliers to cushion margins.

At the same time, a closer look at the earnings yesterday—which beat Wall Street estimates—show Tesla’s profits come from plenty of other sources. It made money from software, from selling regulatory credits for making more than its share of zero-emission cars, and from battery storage and charging.

Of course, robotaxis and self-driving cars are the next frontier. They’re not really cars—the robotaxi won’t even have a steering wheel or pedals. They are a bet on technology and artificial intelligence, not the automotive industry. It’s why Tesla is one of Nvidia’s best customers.

There’s a story about Ray Kroc, the businessman who made McDonald’s the most successful fast-food corporation, and the value of knowing exactly what business you’re really in. For McDonald’s, it’s real estate, not hamburgers.

Elon Musk knows he’s not in the car business. He’s selling the future. The tricky part will be delivering on his promises when expectations are already so high.

Shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a 4% increase in pre-open trading Tuesday, reflecting investor confidence following the company's unveiling of its new quantum computing chip, Willow. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, introduced the chip on Monday, highlighting its ability to significantly reduce computational errors and its performance in benchmark tests.

Pichai emphasized the chip's potential in practical applications, stating, ""We see Willow as an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications in areas like drug discovery, fusion energy, battery design + more.""

The new chip, according to Pichai, has achieved two major milestones. It can exponentially decrease errors with the addition of more qubits, addressing a quantum error correction challenge that has persisted for nearly three decades. In addition, Willow completed a standard benchmark computation in less than five minutes, a task that would take one of the fastest supercomputers today more than 10 septillion years.
This development is part of Google's long-term commitment to quantum computing, a vision that began over a decade ago when Pichai founded Google Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) AI in 2012. 

The goal is to build a quantum computer that leverages quantum mechanics to advance scientific discovery and address societal challenges.

The announcement drew a simple yet telling reaction from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who expressed his astonishment with a single word, ""wow,"" on social media platform X.

The Willow chip represents a significant advancement for Google Quantum AI and positions the company closer to achieving commercially viable quantum computing applications.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hb39my/google_shares_rise_on_new_quantum_chip/

For example, Tesla's stock dropped by more than 70%, and Nvidia experienced a 66% decline in 2022. These sharp fluctuations caused many investors to panic and sell. However, if we had sold during these major drops, we would have missed out on the subsequent huge gains



These stocks have had compound annual growth rates ranging from 40% to 75% For instance, if you had invested $10,000 in Tesla ten years ago, it would now be worth $290,000, and Nvidia return is even more impressive, with a $10,000 investment now worth nearly $2.7 million



This made me realize that an important investment principle is to ""let your winners keep winning"" While there are only a few winners in the market, if we can hold on to them in our portfolio, the returns can be very significant. However, to do this, investors need to overcome the fear of large price fluctuations and avoid selling when prices drop 

It is often only after such fluctuations that these stocks experience the next big rise



Investment guru Charlie Munger once said, ""If you can't calmly endure a 50% drop in stock prices two or three times, you're not suited to be a common shareholder"" I have come to understand that market volatility is inevitable, and investors must learn to accept significant price swings and remain calm during downturns The key is to have a clear investment thesis when buying stocks, understand the company's long term value, and compare the company’s performance to your judgment. If things are progressing as expected, holding on is usually a good idea, because it gives you confidence during market turbulence



In summary, one of the most important investment principles is to continue holding on to the stocks that are performing well, even if they experience significant volatility. Volatility is part of the market, and only by having strong conviction can we maintain long-term returns through market turbulence",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hpq7fr/the_top_5_performing_stocks_of_the_past_decade/

“This new round of funding will enable Waymo to continue to build the world’s leading autonomous driving company,” Alphabet’s outgoing finance chief Ruth Porat said Tuesday on the company’s second-quarter earnings call, adding Waymo is an “important example” of Alphabet’s long-standing investments.

Porat announced the “multiyear” investment on the call and said more information would be available in the company’s quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing, expected on Wednesday. 

Alphabet’s “Other Bets” unit, which includes Waymo, delivered $365 million in quarterly revenue, up from $285 million a year ago. But the unit’s losses widened to $1.13 billion from $813 million in the year-earlier period.

CEO Sundar Pichai said on the earnings call that Waymo provides 50,000 weekly paid trips, primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. It has completed 2 million trips to date. In June, Waymo removed the waitlist and opened Waymo rides to all San Francisco users.

The unit raised $2.25 billion in its first external funding round in 2020. The company raised another $2.5 billion in 2021 in a round that included funding from Andreessen Horowitz, AutoNation, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management & Research Company and more.

Alphabet’s increased investment in Waymo comes after General Motors’ autonomous vehicle unit Cruise said it would indefinitely delay the production of the Origin, a self-driving shuttle designed for use in cities. Tesla on Tuesday delayed plans to unveil its CyberCab, a dedicated robotaxi, from August to Oct. 10.

“Alphabet has committed up to $5B to Waymo,” Waymo CEO Tekedra Mawakana said on X. “We are grateful for their immense vote of confidence in our team and recognizing the amazing progress we’ve made with our technology, product, and commercialization efforts.”

580,19f3fgb,2024-01-25 06:58:05,Why I’m Buying Rivian Stock,"Individual stock picking is for smart people who wear expensive suits. I’m not very smart and I hate wearing suits. I’m a boring index-fund guy. After all, history and math show us that the safe path to retirement is to simply plop money into a Vanguard fund every month. And that’s what I do with most of my money.  
  
But sometimes I see a juicy opportunity that fires me up. Occasionally, the timing of that opportunity is juuuuusst right and I put real money on the line. This is one of those situations and I'd love to hear what you think about it.  
  
I recently bought 4000 shares of Rivian stock (RIVN). My average cost is just over $16/share. That amounts to about $65,000. At the time of this writing, Rivian floats around $15.00/share and has a $14.5b market cap. I might buy another 1000 shares depending on the feedback that I get to this post.  
  
Anyway, here is why I believe Rivian will 3-4x in the next few years. 

# Point #1 – Big Picture - EV’s Will Win… Guaranteed.

Over the next 25 years, the auto industry is going to transition to electric vehicles because they will be cheaper to buy and operate. Hear me out:

1. Right now, batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. But EV battery tech is in its infancy. Incremental advances in batteries will increase the energy density and versatility of batteries year by year. More importantly, the industry will scale battery production by a few orders of magnitude. This will make EV batteries significantly cheaper to purchase on a per unit basis.
2. Government’s will continue to incentivize EV purchases with tax credits and other incentives for decades to come. In the long run, governments are definitely going to incentivize large scale energy creation by renewable means (which is getting cheaper and cheaper). On the other hand, western Governments are not going to subsidize or incentivize more coal power plants. That is just a fact.
3. Moreover, gas cars are only going to get more expensive operate because gas is a finite resource. The world is literally running out of oil. We’ve only got like 100-200 years left. So, gas prices are going to go up guaranteed. On the other hand, we ain’t gonna run out of electricity. Humans will continue to innovate and drive down the relative cost of electricity. This is inevitable.

I know I’m painting with broad strokes here, but I think any rational mind will agree with most of these assertions. Stay with me. This post gets better as I go…  
  
Now, just because EV’s will be less expensive than ICE vehicles in the long run doesn’t mean Rivian is going to win the game. OEM’s like Ford, GM & Stellantis are starting to produce and sell EV’s… right??? Won’t Ford and Toyota and others crush Rivian at the EV game? Nope… not a chance. Keep reading and I’ll show you why.

# Point #2 – Pure EV Makers like Rivian & Telsa Will Crush Traditional Auto Manufacturers

Ford, GM, and Stellantis don’t stand a chance against Tesla & Rivian. Even if they start making compelling EV’s for customers, OEM’s will be at a long-term structural disadvantage to Rivian & Tesla. Here is why:

1. Rivian does not have a dealership sales model. Dealerships are a useless 3rd party which customers hate. Removing the dealership permits Rivian to sell its vehicles for cheaper than it otherwise could, but also make more profit than it otherwise could. This will be a long-term structural competitive advantage over OEMs.
2. Rivian does not have unions. Unions uniquely harm the automobile industry because the cost of strikes and the cost of artificial wage increases after the strike ends increase the cost of vehicles. The 2023 UAW strike is a good example. If Rivian treats its employees with dignity and respect, they should avoid unionization. This will be a long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.
3. Rivian will make money from servicing and repairing vehicles. In the current OEM-dealership model, the dealership makes more money from the service department than it does selling vehicles. While it generally costs less to service and maintain an EV, collisions & accidents can be more expensive to repair than ICE vehicles. There is a lot of money to be made by repairing & servicing EVs and Rivian has it’s own service department. As such, it will capture that revenue as opposed to giving it to the dealership. This will be another long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.
4. Rivian is vertically integrated (especially when it comes to software). Traditional auto companies are not. These companies suck at software. Meanwhile, customers want high quality software in their vehicles that works seamlessly with their phones, homes, and other devices. Rivian, at its core, is a software driven company. This allows them to update their vehicles over-the-air. This will give them an enormous advantage in the long run at improving, iterating, fixing and keeping their customers happy.

Okay, okay, okay… I’ve convinced you that pure EV companies are going to have inherent advantages over traditional auto. That still doesn’t mean that Rivian is going to be a winner. After all… Tesla is crushing them right now. Rivian isn’t even profitable yet. If you’re going to bet on a pure EV, why not pick Tesla???  
  
Tesla is great. I’ve got nothing bad to say about it. They make amazing cars, they have a genius founder, and it has amazing long-term potential. But this write-up isn’t about Tesla. I don’t think Rivian is better than Tesla. It’s not.   
  
This write-up is more about the timing of things for Rivian. I think Rivian’s stock is uniquely undervalued right now relative to where it should be. I personally feel like this value disparity is easier for me to see for Rivian than it is for Tesla.   
  
Anyway, lets continue….

# Point #3 – Rivian Makes Wonderful Vehicles that Customers Love

Rivian makes beautiful vehicles and customers love them. The outdoor-adventure brand is on point. Aesthetics and brand really matter to buyers, and Rivian vehicles rock.   
  
While most people hear the name “Rivian” they think of Rivian’s truck (R1T). But in reality their higher-priced SUV, (R1S) is far more popular. The CEO said on an earnings call that the demand is for 2 R1S’s for every 1 R1T.   
  
Now, I see a lot of R1T’s and R1S on the road here in CA. And I see more and more of them each week. Just about every single R1S driver I see here in California is good-looking mom driving her kids to soccer. That’s a good sign. I’m convinced that middle & upper-class women absolutely love the R1S. I think the R1S is going to be enormously popular. Remember how popular Range Rovers were about ten years ago? I think the R1S is going to be that kind of popular….  
  
But the R1S doesn’t just appeal to soccer moms. I want one. And I’m a guy who likes to go off-roading, camping, and hiking. I’m a dude, and I love Rivian vehicles. I think the R1S is going to be a massive hit.   
  
Whether you believe me or not, no one can dispute that outdoor adventure brands really resonate with humans. Maybe that is why Rivian was ranked highest in customer satisfaction by JD Power in 2023. There is a lasting durability to selling adventure. I think Rivian’s brand is built to last.  
  
Moreover, I really like Rivian’s management team. The CEO, RJ Scaringe, and CFO, Claire McDonough, just seem to work hard with their heads down. I personally like that RJ is an engineer who went to MIT. While they have clearly made a few mistakes, I don’t think they have made any big ones. They are not flashy or full of crap (think Nikola…).  
  
But EVEN if I’m right about everything so far, that still doesn’t mean Rivian is a good stock to buy. Keep reading to hear the good stuff….

# Point #4 – Rivian Has Enormous Upside Right Now

Why would anyone want to invest in Rivian right now? At a surface level, Rivian looks like they have big problems:

* Currently, Rivian is losing money on every R1 vehicle it sells. It allegedly makes money on its electric delivery vans but does not disclose how much.
* Moreover, Rivian got crushed in 2022 in the supply chain shortage that delayed vehicle production. Theoretically, that could happen again.
* Then interest rates started rising in 2023 making it more expensive for normal people to get a loan to buy these pricey vehicles. Most people who buy vehicles finance or lease them. Very few people buy them with cash.
* Rivian has had growing-pains with their vehicles. They’ve had recalls (steering issue), mechanical issues (tonneau cover defect), accessory issues (wireless phone charger defect), and a bunch of other minor problems. These growing pains would really frustrate me if I spent $95k on a vehicle.
* Rivian will be shutting down its production line for a few weeks in Q2 of 2024 to make improvements to the manufacturing line. This is definitely going to slow their numbers for that quarter.
* Beyond that, even if Rivian miraculously scaled production to max capacity tomorrow at their Normal, Illinois, manufacturing plant, (150,000 vehicles) and sold every vehicle at their current prices, I don’t think the company would be profitable to a level that would excite me. 

Well all this sounds terrible! Why on earth would anyone buy their stock now??? Oh boy… let me tell you why….

&#x200B;

* **Mass-Market Vehicle Announcement** \- If you’ve been following Rivian, you know that it does not have a chance of long-term success unless it introduces and starts selling a mass market vehicle much like Tesla did with the Model 3 in 2017. 
   * The Model S really launched Tesla into the public eye in 2014/15. But it didn’t start making real money until the Model 3. The R1 line at Rivian is meant to be Rivian’s “Model S.” It has successfully done that. People love the product. Now, the only way Rivian will become profitable is if it starts building it’s own Model 3. And that is about to happen.
   * Rivian plans to introduce the R2 on March 7, 2024, in Laguna Beach, CA. This is supposed to be an affordable midsize SUV costing anywhere between $40,000 and $50,000 per vehicle. If it is anything like the R1S, I suspect it will be beautiful and a high-quality competitor to the Model Y – the most popular selling EV in the world. 
   * Rivian is currently building a manufacturing plant in Georgia to produce the R2. It has broken ground and should be finished in early 2026. Once up and fully scaled, it should be able to make 400,000 vehicles per year.

&#x200B;

* **Steadily Marching to Profitability** \- As it continues to scale up production, Rivian’s loss per vehicle is shrinking dramatically quarter after quarter. In Q3 2022, it lost $139,277 per vehicle. That egregious. But that number was expected at the time and now it is shrinking dramatically. In Q3 of 2023, it lost $30,600 per vehicle. That is still a lot, but the change from one year earlier is monumental. 
   * Management claims they will be gross margin profitable per vehicle at the end of Q4 2024. Management says the delta they are chasing is literally baked into contracts it has with its suppliers. As they increase and improve production throughout 2024, the margin on labor per vehicle and parts from suppliers gets better and better.
   * On the 2023 Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, “Overall, we continue to see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high-teens adjusted EBITDA margin target, and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.”

&#x200B;

* **Interest Rates Will Go Down** \- Despite a full year of rising interest rates, Rivian’s demand has been so high it has not needed to reduce prices in order to sell its very expensive vehicles. In fact, it raised prices in March 2023. Meanwhile, other EV manufacturers like Tesla have slashed prices. 
   * In December 2024, the federal reserve signaled it will no longer raise interest rates, and will probably start cutting them slowly over the next few years. This means demand for Rivian vehicles will only go up as their production scales up. That sounds like perfect timing. 
   * Moreover, when the fed starts cutting rates, trillions of dollars will start flowing back into the market, increasing valuations. Read Warren Buffet’s 1999 Fortune article called Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market. IMO, it is highly likely that “speculative” stocks like Rivian and Tesla will be enormous beneficiaries of all this buying. The fed may start cutting rates as early as the end of Q1 2024 (but more likely Q2 or Q3 2024).

&#x200B;

* **EV’s Have Been Unfairly Beaten Up in the News Lately** – Starting in mid/late 2023, there has been a lot of speculation in the financial news that EV’s are overhyped and will not take over the market as previously thought. This fear, uncertainty, and doubt has suppressed the share prices of all the pure EV players. If this FUD has any validity at all, it is only a short-term speed bump.
   * Remember, the inherent and structural advantages of pure EV manufacturers will win out in the long run because the costs to buy EV’s will be lower than ICE vehicles (See Point #1 & 2 above). Over time, this will prove decisive. Moreover, for some reason, the conservative side of the news media loves to bash EVs. This is just silly politics and will end with time. I mean, why on earth would conservatives honestly dislike American made vehicles with ridiculous amounts of horsepower! The bashing will end with time. I’m confident of that.

&#x200B;

* **Rivian could announce new EDV deal at any time…** Right now, Rivian has orders to sell about 85,000 more EDV’s to Amazon by 2030 under their 100,000 vehicle contract. This deal used to be “exclusive” with Amazon, but this contract was recently changed and now Rivian can sell EDV’s to other delivery companies. That is fantastic.
   * What is even better is that on November 7, 2023, RJ Scaringe said in Q3 earnings call that “We’ll be announcing soon a range of different pilot programs that will perceive much larger orders, as these large fleets start to plan the electrification of their infrastructure.”
   * A month later, in December, Rivian recently announced a pilot deal to sell an undisclosed number of EDV’s to AT&T. This shot Rivian’s share price up and made investors happy. This could lead to a much larger deal in the future.
   * I strongly suspect that several more pilot programs with other delivery companies will be announced in the coming months. Over time these deals will mature and large orders will be placed.

&#x200B;

* **Attractive Price** \- In 2021, Rivian made its IPO during the EV stimulus-uphoria at $78/share. I did not buy a single share back then. That sounded crazy overpriced for an unproven capital-intensive car company. The share price immediately jumped near to $130/share and it has done nothing but go down ever since. It’s down over 85% to $15.50. We are close to its all-time lows. I think this presents an amazing opportunity to buy at a discount.
   * Rivian’s Value Compared to Competitors – Right now, Rivian’s market cap is $14.5 billion. This is small compared to Ford’s at $44 billion, GM’s at $47 billion, and Stellantis at $63 billion. While Rivian clearly sells less vehicles than these competitors, Rivian’s future is much brighter. I suspect a forward-looking stock market will quickly buy shares of Rivian over the next three years if it continues to make strong gains. While it will take a long time for the market to see Rivian as a premier competitor like Tesla or Toyota, I can easily see Rivian’s market cap soaring past Ford, GM, & Stellantis in the next three years if it’s R2 launch is successful. 

&#x200B;

* **Tesla Supercharger Access**
   * Range anxiety is a real thing. Until America’s EV charging infrastructure is as dependable as gas stations, it’s going to be a big factor in the buying decision. Fortunately, Tesla has paved the way and built an amazing supercharging network across the country that is extremely dependable. While Rivian is building its own network (Rivian Adventure Network), it will never be as robust as Tesla’s. Until recently, Tesla chargers were for Tesla drivers only. But not anymore….
   * Tesla recently announced it was going to permit competitors vehicles like Rivian to access and use its network. This is enormous news for future buyers as it will absolutely quell most of the range anxiety concerns.
   * Rivian also announced it was adopting Tesla’s North American Charging Standard plug. This is the plug that Tesla uses on its vehicles. Starting in 2025, Rivian vehicles will come standard with this plug. I don’t know about you, but I think this will help hundreds of thousands of people make the decision to switch from an ICE car to an EV. 

If you’ve been around the market for any length of time at all, you know that the stock market is forward looking. It is constantly trying to figure out what the future holds based on all available data and placing its bet accordingly. I think most of the seven points I just made are largely unappreciated or discounted by the smart people in suits. And that is why the share price is lower than it should be. That is where our opportunity lies.  
  
However, this investing thing is not for weaklings….

# Point #5 – Not Gonna Lie… There Are Big Risks:

I’m not some delusional nerd who doesn’t understand how hard it is to make accurate predictions like this. There are some big risks here. These are the biggest ones that I see:

&#x200B;

* **What if the R2 Vehicle Announcement Falls Flat?**
   * When the R2 is announced on March 7th, it’s possible that the reaction will be poor. The SUV could look terrible, the specs could be unappealing, or the price could be too high. 
   * I think this is unlikely. Considering the care, consideration, and thought that has gone into the R1S and R1T, I expect the R2 to be a big hit and a full extension of the outdoor-adventure brand.

&#x200B;

* **What if there is a Demand Problem?** 
   * It’s possible there is a demand problem for the R1 vehicles and the sales are not as good as I believe they are. It’s possible that inventory is rising. In early January 2024 Rivian announced it produced 17,541 and delivered 13,972 in Q4 2023. When these numbers were announced, the stock dropped 10%. 
   * Why the 3,569 difference? Well, between making a vehicle and selling it to a customer, it takes some time to sell, ship, and for the customer to take possession. For vehicles made in December, you can easily imagine some of those don’t actually get delivered until January. 
   * But why 3,569? That seems like a lot to account for that simple lag between production and delivery. According to the Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, “As a reminder, because Amazon limits the intake of new commercial vans during its peak holiday delivery period, we expect a more significant gap between production and deliveries in Q4 relative to prior periods.” I find this explanation pretty satisfying. 
   * But if this large gap remains at the end of Q1 2024, or grows, I’m gonna start to get worried.

&#x200B;

* **What if Building the Georgia Plant Runs into Problems?**
   * It’s possible that there are major roadblocks to building the brand new R2 plant in Georgia. My imagination can go wild thinking about delays, permits, politics, protests, bureaucracy, accidents, and the “production hell” issues that Elon Musk talks about. 
   * The good thing is that Rivian has gone through the production process on three different vehicles in Illinois and that experience should speed the process up. But who knows what kind of disasters could come up building a plant from scratch.

&#x200B;

* **What if the March to Profitability Stalls or Reverses?**
   * It’s possible that Rivian’s current march to profitability will slow to a crawl, stop, or reverse entirely. This would be bad. In the next quarter earnings statement on February 21st, Rivian better post a smaller loss than $30,600 per vehicle (Q3 2023). It better be in the mid $20k or better… Absent a really good and logical explanation, I’m going to be seriously alarmed if it doesn’t get somewhere in that range.
   * If this happens, that would be a strong signal that Rivian is just making too good of a car and they either need to increase the price, or make it cheaper.
   * I honestly doubt this will happen. The way the CEO and CFO handle their earnings calls inspires confidence in their managerial ability. But that is my suuuuper subjective perspective. 

&#x200B;

* **What if they Issue More Debt and/or Dilution?** 
   * Rivian will probably have to raise more money to complete the plant in Georgia. But they are going to spend $5 billion to build the R2 plant in Georgia and they need to continue ramping production in Illinois. That’s a ton in capital outlay. 
   * Luckily, that fat IPO set Rivian up nice. Currently, Rivian has very little debt ($3bil) and a strong balance sheet (they have like $8-9 billion in cash/equivalents).
   * But raising capital will either come in the form of more debt or share dilution. Either way, it won’t be great for the owners of the stock. But Wall Street already knows this, so nobody is going to freak out if it’s a small capital raise. But if its huge, yeah, I’m gonna freak out too.

&#x200B;

* **What if Interest Rates Rise?** 
   * Inflation could spike back up like it did in the 70’s. That would prompt the fed to raise interest rates again. I think this is unlikely, but it would be a bad for every auto company if it happened.

&#x200B;

* **What if Repair Cost Fears Grow?** 
   * The last big risk is something I don’t hear very many investment folk talk about. Repair costs.
   * Repair costs seem to be very high for EV vehicles, and Rivian’s in particular. There are many stories of a medium size dent on a fender costing the customer $20-30k. This kind of stuff, if true, will drive up insurance costs. This is a red flag/danger area that will deter some cautious buyers. 
   * I’m not terribly worried about this. In theory, as more cars get made, repair costs will go down. But this will take time.

# Point #6 - Rivian is Not the Next Tesla (But it Doesn’t Have to Be)

I feel like everyone just wants to compare Rivian to Tesla. I think that is unwise when evaluating this investment.

Rivian only produced 57,000 vehicles in 2023. In the same timeframe, Tesla produced 1,850,000. These two companies are not even in the same universe. Tesla is at least 7-10 years ahead of Rivian. But that doesn’t matter at all for the question of whether or not you should own Rivian stock.

The great thing here is that if Tesla continues to win with the Model Y and Cybertruck, that will likely be a net benefit for Rivian. Tesla has smashed the entrenched auto-industry to bits, and Rivian is poised to take advantage of rebuilding it in the new vision of the future. The customer needs alternatives to Tesla. And Rivian is better positioned to capture market share from Subaru, Jeep, Land Rover, Toyota, Chevorlet and other brands that make adventure style trucks and SUV’s.

Tesla’s stock went from $15 a share in September of 2019 to $235 by the end of 2020. That meteoric rise was the result of a decade of work, becoming profitable, and the stimulus froth of the Covid recovery. Even if Rivian smashes its forecasts for the next two years, Rivian stock will not do what Tesla did. Tesla is so much more than a car company. As it stands, Rivian is just a car company….

But I do believe Rivian could easily get back to its IPO price in the of $70’s if it executes well on its vision over the next 2-3 years. That is what I’m hoping for. 

# Conclusion

I spent all day writing this. I’m tired of typing. I hope someone out there can poke some holes in my thesis so I can sell my shares and put my $$ back into an index fund where it belongs. But I also hope that I’m right and this stock gradually rises in value over the next few years. Right now I’m committed. I’m freaking pumped about it.

* [BYD vs. Tesla market share.](https://i.imgur.com/oP0EnLO.png)


Chinese automaker expands its electric-vehicle lineup to more than 20 models in its push overseas and into higher price brackets

https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/a-lamborghini-style-ev-byd-goes-upmarket-to-outmaneuver-tesla-2b698578

HONG KONG— BYD overtook TSLA as the world’s top electric-vehicle seller by pumping out a range of affordable cars that gave Chinese drivers what they wanted: choice. 

Now it is moving into the luxury market as it prepares to take on the world.

BYD is releasing the cars under a different brand, Yangwang, marking a strategy shift from relying on lower-priced runarounds to producing less conventional vehicles that come with a hefty price tag. They include a $150,000 supercar that resembles a Lamborghini and an SUV that it says can rotate 360 degrees on the spot and float in water—features that turn heads in China’s cutthroat car market where buyers chase the latest smart technology.

Tesla, meanwhile, banks on continuing strong global demand mostly for its Model 3 and Model Y cars, which it refreshed last year. Tesla’s Cybertruck, its first release in years, isn’t available in China, though the automaker is planning to take the vehicle on a roadshow in the country.

In China, the world’s biggest EV market, Tesla’s market share has been shrinking: BYD now sells five cars to every one that the U.S. automaker does. BYD’s popularity has surged as it cranks out new and varied models at a rapid pace, growing its portfolio of electric vehicles to more than two dozen models, catering to almost every taste and budget. 

Backed by Warren Buffett, BYD has become so dominant in its home market that sales in the country enabled it to dethrone Elon Musk’s automaker as the bestselling global EV brand last quarter.

BYD also has ambitious export and expansion plans. BYD has topped EV sales charts in Thailand and is quickly rising in markets including Australia and Israel. It is building factories in Brazil, Hungary and Thailand. Its first chartered cargo ship with a capacity for 7,000 vehicles set sail for Europe this month.

Whether BYD can repeat its home success on the global stage depends on whether it can translate the formula winning over Chinese buyers to international consumers. In the U.S., South Korean carmakers Hyundai Motor and Kia are emerging as Tesla’s biggest competition by offering a broader range of vehicles.

Challenges loom large for BYD as Chinese carmakers face pressure on profit margins at home, deal with a subsidy probe in Europe, and remain largely shut out from the U.S., where BYD has long had ambitions to sell passenger EVs. 

Beyond existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese cars, the Inflation Reduction Act will exclude cars made with Chinese components from EV tax credits. For now, the company has been manufacturing and selling buses and trucks in the U.S. Its current strategy is to focus on commercial vehicles in the U.S., a company spokeswoman said. 

**Export ambition**

BYD expects to export 400,000 cars abroad this year, a goal that is achievable, said CMB International analyst Ji Shi. Exports offering higher profit margins are likely to become the next engine of growth for BYD, HSBC analysts wrote in a note earlier this month. 

BYD has yet to make much progress toward its main prize: Europe. BYD is estimated to have sold around 13,000 cars in the European Union last year, far from Tesla’s 270,000, according to figures compiled by data firm GlobalData. 

In China, BYD held almost 12% of the passenger-car market and Tesla under 3% for the first 11 months of last year, according to figures compiled by GlobalData. Tesla was the market leader in electric vehicles four years ago. While Tesla’s Model Y remained the most popular electric car in China last year, BYD claimed half of the nation’s 20 bestselling electric models as it churned out new minivans and sedans.

BYD “has the China market completely covered for the most part,” said Tu Le, consultant at Sino Auto Insights.

This month, Tesla cut prices in China for some versions of the Model 3 and Model Y, the latest fluctuation over the past year as carmakers engage in a price war in China. Tesla’s refresh of its Models 3 and Y last year added new features such as ambient interior lighting and a smaller rear screen, features that analysts said were already common among Chinese EVs and might not move the needle for Tesla.  

Tesla didn’t respond to requests for comment.

While Tesla has fended off past challenges from a range of Chinese automakers, BYD’s move upmarket presents drivers with more prestigious homegrown choices over foreign rivals.

A price tag of 150,000 yuan, equivalent to around $21,000, used to be the ceiling customers were thought to be prepared to pay for Chinese-branded vehicles, a BYD executive said. Customers flaunted their status with an imported Western vehicle as there were no Chinese-designed cars priced above a million yuan, BYD sales representatives said.

**Delivery ceremonies**

Yangwang luxury vehicles are sold through direct-sales showrooms separate to BYD. Customers picking up their vehicles are offered a delivery ceremony, complete with balloons and floral decorations for special occasions such as a birthday, marriage proposals or anniversaries. 

Buyers of its hybrid U8 SUV have the car key delivered in a gift box, nested with a miniature of the vehicle. BYD videos show the U8 doing a full 360-degree “tank turn” on the spot, which has garnered a lot of attention on Chinese social media. 

Jin Songchang, a Chinese businessman, was shopping for an off-road SUV to drive across China’s vast provinces once he retires. After months of test driving luxury foreign cars, he finally whipped out a deposit for BYD’s U8, which costs just over $150,000. 

Jin said he was swayed to BYD after company founder Wang Chuanfu said at its launch event that the U8 can run steadily on just three wheels if a tire bursts, thanks to its four powerful in-wheel motors. Jin placed a deposit the next day.

“I’ve always appreciated foreign brands more. BYD is the first one I decided to buy on the spot,” added Jin, who said he owns many cars.

Together with its other two high-end car brands, BYD counted more than 135,500 orders of premium and luxury cars in 2023, according to company data. The U8 SUV will be available in Brazil, the company said last year.  

BYD has yet to open up sales for its supercar, the U9, after it was revealed at the Shanghai Auto Show in April. The sports car can accelerate from 0 to 62 miles in two seconds. This month, Yangwang teased its coming luxury sedan.

BYD is following the footsteps of companies such as General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen with its family of different car brands, analysts say.

588,1h7clsd,2024-12-05 16:06:20,"Waymo to expand to Miami, aims to launch robotaxi service there in 2026","Waymo is setting its sights on its next location: the Sunshine State.

The Alphabet-owned company announced Thursday that it will be hitting the roads in Miami. Waymo said it will first begin cruising through the Florida city with human safety drivers in 2025 before opening doors to riders for its robotaxi service through its Waymo One app in 2026.

The expansion into Miami is indicative of Waymo’s growing confidence in operating its self-driving vehicles in harsher weather conditions in large metropolitan areas in the U.S.

Waymo first tested in Miami in 2019, which the company said helped improve the ability of its self-driving vehicles to navigate in wet and rainy conditions.

“We deepened our learning and understanding of the Waymo Driver’s performance in adverse weather conditions,” a company spokesperson said.

Waymo will use what it learned when it returns to the city with its all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs next year.

The company said its initial territory in Florida will include some parts of Miami’s larger metropolitan area, which has a population of more than 6 million people.

Waymo has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

In November, the company announced it was removing its waitlist of about 300,000 people in Los Angeles, so anyone would be able to use Waymo One to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout the nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County. The company’s ride-hailing service also operates citywide in Phoenix and San Francisco.

And in September, Waymo announced a partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta. Through that deal, Uber riders will be able to access Waymo’s robotaxis through the Uber app starting in early 2025, and Uber will be responsible for fleet management and operations of the Waymo vehicles, including maintenance and infrastructure, such as vehicle charging, cleaning and repairs. 

Additionally, Waymo on Thursday announced that it will partner with mobility company Moove to manage its fleet operations, facilities and charging infrastructure in both Miami and Phoenix. Moove will begin managing Waymo’s Phoenix fleet in early 2025, a Waymo spokesperson said. 

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture’s parent company, Alphabet, which also owns Google, led the funding round alongside earlier backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company said it now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week via the Waymo One app across San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. 

Waymo is the only autonomous vehicle developer that currently operates a commercial robotaxi service in several major metro areas across the U.S., but competitors are looming. 

GM-owned Cruise is working on bringing its autonomous vehicles back into use on public roads after discontinuing its services following an accident where one of its self-driving cars injured a pedestrian in San Francisco. 

Tesla, meanwhile, showed off design concepts for a self-driving Cybercab and Robovan at an event in October. However, Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software in its vehicles as “partially automated driving systems,” which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025.

SoftBank-funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, and Amazon-owned Zoox is also testing its self-driving cars, which do not feature steering wheels, in several U.S. cities.

590,1b93jvo,2024-03-07 19:53:44,"Rivian shares surge as company reveals new EV models, $2.25 billion in cost savings","Shares of Rivian Automotive surged roughly 10% Thursday as the EV maker unveiled three new vehicles and announced more than $2 billion in savings related to pausing construction on a plant in Georgia.

Two of those EVs came as a surprise to consumers and investors. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe, in announcing the company’s upcoming R2 SUV, also revealed two additional crossovers called the R3 and R3X, a performance variant.

The R2 is expected to start at about $45,000 when it goes on sale during the first half of 2026. It’s expected to be the fourth product for Rivian following a commercial delivery van and larger, more expensive R1S SUV and R1T pickup for consumers. The R1 vehicles start at roughly $70,000 and can top $100,000.

Scaringe disclosed few details about the surprise R3 crossovers, but told CNBC’s Phil LeBeau that the R3 will be priced lower than the R1.

“These represent our future,” Scaringe said during a livestreamed event from Laguna Beach, California.

The announcements come at a crucial time for Rivian as it attempts to expand its customer base amid slower-than-expected EV sales in the U.S. after automakers flooded the first-adopter market with pricey all-electric vehicles in recent years.

Rivian’s sales pace has slowed in recent quarters, and the company widely disappointed investors last month by missing quarterly estimates and forecasting slightly lower production this year compared to 2023 due to plant downtime.

The Amazon-backed company has been burning through cash to improve current EV production and narrow losses.

Shifting production of the R2 from the in-development plant in Georgia to the company’s plant in Normal, Illinois, will save $2.25 billion, Rivian said in a press release. It will also allow the vehicle to begin production earlier, it said.

The company said it will pause construction on the Georgia plant, to be resumed “later.”

The R2 will operate on a new EV platform but looks like a smaller version of the R1S SUV. It will be capable of more than 300 miles of all-electric range on a single charge and 0-60 mph time in under3 seconds, the company said.

“R2 represents the essence of our brand, while targeting the significant midsized SUV segment, a massive market with limited compelling EV options beyond Tesla,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told investors last month. “R2 has been developed with vertically integrated propulsion platforms, electronics and software to create an incredible user experience.”

593,1dbvyv3,2024-06-09 15:11:21,Bear Case: Why I believe Alphabet will do everything right and still lose,"Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue.

With the ""Attention is all you need"" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch.

But even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift.

Much of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo.

Ultimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dbvyv3/bear_case_why_i_believe_alphabet_will_do/

**European Union votes to impose tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles**

&#x200B;

*Key Points*

* *The European Union on Friday voted to adopt definitive tariffs on China-made battery electric vehicles (BEVs).*
* *“Today, the European Commission’s proposal to impose definitive countervailing duties on imports of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from China has obtained the necessary support from EU Member States for the adoption of tariffs,” the EU said in a statement.*
* *The EU added that it was still working in China to look for “an alternative solution” even as the tariffs are adopted.*

&#x200B;

*The European Union on Friday voted to adopt definitive tariffs on China-made battery electric vehicles (BEVs).*

*“Today, the European Commission’s proposal to impose definitive countervailing duties on imports of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from China has obtained the necessary support from EU Member States for the adoption of tariffs,” the EU said in a statement.*

*It added that the decision marked another step toward the conclusion of the Commission’s anti-subsidy investigation into electric vehicles from China, which was launched in October 2023.*

*The EU first announced that it would slap higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports in June, on the grounds that they benefit “heavily from unfair subsidies” and posed a “threat of economic injury” to electric vehicle producers in Europe.*

*Duties were also disclosed for individual companies that linked to their levels of cooperation and information they supplied to the EU as part of the bloc’s probe into EV production in China.*

*Provisional duties were put in place from early July.*

*The European Commission then revised its tariff plans in September based on “substantiated comments on the provisional measures” from interested parties.*

*A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce told reporters that Beijing continues to believe that the investigation into China’s subsidies for its electric vehicle industry has come to “pre-set conclusions,” adding that the bloc is promoting unfair competition.*

*On Friday, the EU said it was still looking for other solutions, even as the tariffs are adopted.*

*“In parallel, the EU and China continue to work hard to explore an alternative solution that would have to be fully WTO-compatible, adequate in addressing the injurious subsidization established by the Commission’s investigation, monitorable and enforceable,” it said.*

&#x200B;

*Industry response*

&#x200B;

*German automakers criticized the EU’s decision.*

*Mercedes Benz called the tariffs a “mistake” and urged the European Commission to delay their implementation, while BMW said the move marked a “fatal sign” for Europe’s auto industry, Reuters reported. Crisis-stricken Volkswagen meanwhile called on the EU and China to continue talks about the issue, saying that an alternative solution was still possible, according to Reuters.*

*Swedish auto maker Volvo Cars, which is owned by China’s Geely Holdings, said that it would “continue with our long-held strategy of building our cars where we sell them and have committed significant long-term investment into Europe,” according to a statement.*

&#x200B;

*Division in the EU*

&#x200B;

*The decision comes after months of debates and deliberations between EU member countries, which have expressed varying opinions on increasing tariffs on imported Chinese made EVs.*

*While France has been a big supporter, previously pushing the EU to start investigations of potential tariffs, Germany has advocated against them, raising concerns about consequences for its own struggling car makers.*

*German Finance Minister Christian Lindner on Friday urged the European Commission not to start a trade war.*

*“Despite the vote for potential punitive tariffs against China, Ursula von der Leyen’s EU Commission should not trigger a trade war. We need a negotiated solution,” he said in a post on social media platform X according to a CNBC translation.*

*Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Thursday his country would veto a proposal from the European Commission that puts forward tariffs of up to 45%, Reuters reported.*

*Potential retaliation from China has been a key concern for some EU members, especially as China has already launched anti-dumping probes into pork and brandy exports from the EU, as well as an anti-subsidy investigation into EU dairy products.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fvvy1i/european_union_votes_to_impose_tariffs_on_chinese/

596,1fierfw,2024-09-16 20:18:25,"Intel stock jumps on plan to turn foundry unit into subsidiary, allow outside funding","Intel shares jumped almost 10% in extended trading on Monday after the company said it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital.

As part of CEO Pat Gelsinger’s effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera.

Gelsinger said the restructuring would allow Foundry to “evaluate independent sources of funding,” and comes days after Intel’s board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it for the last two years.

Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named to discuss confidential information.

With a standalone “operating board” and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully-integrated unit into a separate company.

Intel has lost almost 60% of its value this year, as the company has lost market share in its core PC and data center market and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. Last month, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest selloff in 50 years, and said it would lay off over 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.

Intel will also pause its fab efforts in Poland and Germany “by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand,” Gelsinger said. The chipmaker will also pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said.

The company is also roughly halfway towards the layoffs announced in August, Gelsinger said.

Intel also announced on Monday that it had entered into a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips for AI.

The move is a vote of confidence in Intel’s quest to manufacture custom chips for companies in its foundry business, in addition to designing its own products.

It extends a long-running partnership between the two companies. Amazon is a large end customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers, and will buy a custom Xeon processor from Intel as well, Intel said.

It also will allow Intel a new foothold in the growing industry for AI server chips. While Intel has several products that can be used for AI, including one called Gaudi 3, Nvidia has largely taken control of the market.

Amazon has developed its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have invested heavily in custom chips to run AI in hopes that theirs would be less expensive or offer other advantages over than Nvidia’s general-purpose GPUs.

The company said that the chips would be made on the company’s 18A process, which is expected to be used in production in 2025. Analysts expect the manufacturing technology to be similar to TSMC’s forthcoming 2nm process. (The first chips using TSMC’s 3nm process are shipping now in Apple’s iPhone.)

Intel said that it would perform its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio that’s currently under construction.

“All eyes will remain on us. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because that’s the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know we’re capable of achieving,” Gelsinger said.

Last quarter, Carvana reported insane numbers, including a GPU of $6,432, which was a 50% increase year over year. We have since learned that Carvana bought a large number of Teslas from Hertz when they went bankrupt at steep discounts. This egregiously elevated their numbers to a severely unsustainable level. 

  
**BEAR THESIS:** 

* The co-founder and CEO sold 1,590,000 shares in July alone. This does not include the millions of shares he sold in 2024. 
* Carvana has $3,000,000,000 (yes, 3 billion) in debt that it pays 10.25% to service every year. 

  
I can't say I didn't tell you so. 

  
1 last quality bit of information: the CEO and co-founder is a con man and a criminal. He pleaded guilty to felony bank fraud in 1990. I 100% guarantee he is cooking this company's books.

I'm talking about specific sectors of the market that went crazy, not a specific stock that went up a lot (like GME) or when literally *everything* went up like crazy (like in 2020-2021).

But it seems that every few months or couple years, we get HUGE hype about a certain sector and everyone piles in until it pops and then nobody talks about it again (at least for many years).

I don't remember the exact years, but I remember:

* solar (2006?)
* ethanol (2008?)
* crypto (2016?)
* weed (2018?)
* semiconductors (now)

I'm sure there are many more that I missed because some years I wasn't in the market or I just plain forgot.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

602,195j02j,2024-01-13 07:59:27,"Hertz Wants to Sell 20,000 EVs Amid Low Rental Demand, High Repair Prices","Just over two years after announcing plans to purchase 100,000 Teslas and another 65,000 electric cars from Polestar for its rental fleets, Hertz is planning to sell off 20,000 of its EVs, according to a federal regulatory filing posted Thursday. The rental company noted the high cost of collision repairs and lower demand from consumers as the primary drivers for the EV divestment. Hertz, in turn, plans to use some of the income from those sales to purchase more new gas-powered vehicles.

The electric rental demand issue may have less to do with the cars themselves and more to do with the unique traits of EVs. An average renter is looking for a car that will get them around over the course of a trip rather than a compelling experience in that car. For those customers, the complexities of an EV may prove to be more of a frustration than a charm.

Renting a Tesla Model 3, for instance, comes with all the frustrations of the screen-heavy Tesla user interface without any of the time to get used to those adjustments that a buyer would have. Charging is an even bigger issue: Not only do consumers without EV experience who rent a Polestar 2 or a Tesla Model 3 have to figure out how to charge a car while on the road, they also have to figure out two completely different charging ecosystems depending on which car they get.

Even though Hertz plans to offload much of its electric fleet, the company says it ""will continue to execute its strategy around EV mobility and offer customers a wide selection of vehicles,"" according to the filing. Hertz says it will grow its charging infrastructure, work closer with electric car manufacturers to lower parts and labor costs, and continue to help educate customers about EVs.

Hertz currently lists 548 Tesla Model 3s and zero Polestar models on its direct sales website. The most affordable Teslas are currently selling for just over $20,000, but screenshots shared by Electrek on Wednesday suggest that other Model 3s have previously been listed for as low as $17,700 before a potential tax credit for used EVs.

603,1b5v744,2024-03-03 23:11:54,Is Google’s Waymo potential underrated?,"It seems to me that among the recent Gemini headlines (which I find personally quite overblown, as Meta’s very advanced AI displayed the same flaws, and Microsoft’s Copilot was shown to display some real nonsense as well), people have kind of lost track of the autonomous vehicle business. 

Waymo is by far the most advanced technology of all autonomous vehicle companies in existence. I’m not sure if people are fully aware that Waymo already has a commercial driverless taxi service in operation. I haven’t tried it but watched videos and it seems to work amazingly well. People love to nitpick autonomous vehicles and say “oh x and y are not working perfectly well”, but let’s be real, human taxi drivers are far from perfect and the service seems to be working far, far better than the average taxi driver. This week, Waymo received approval to run their commercial service in Los Angeles. 

While most carmakers dabble in their own autonomous driving technology, many of them also have collaborations with Waymo. I see real potential for Waymo to become the de facto provider for most carmakers - the way that for years, many parallel charging networks existed, and very suddenly the majority of carmakers signed on to Tesla’s solution as the dominos kept falling one after the other. 

With all the news around ChatGPT, most investors seem to use “AI” interchangeably with “chatbot” or more generally “LLM” or “image generation”. But autonomous driving is in fact AI as well.

Google also owns Deepmind which has been at the absolute cutting edge for AI for many years now. I feel like most people overlook this because you can’t just go to Deepmind.com and have a conversation with their AI. But they are doing some incredibly advanced stuff in scientific fields. Monetizing all of that is going to be a different story but I feel that from a technology standpoint, Google is very much doing impressive things:

It doesn’t make sense. PE ratio is good, and it’s the second largest in the world in car sales.

You could say sales are declining, but so does Ford’s (even more), but it didn’t tank that much.

They keep manufacturing a very diversified range of cars from cheap boring to supercars (indirectly through child brands, but still), and even though its sales isn’t expected to be growing as much as Tesla, but comparing the two is still a joke, and in my opinion Tesla will never be even close to sales of Volkswagen. Still, Tesla’s valuation is 10x Volkswagens.

I don’t mean to start comparing the two, and soon it won’t even be relevant as Tesla is not an automobile only company, but let’s be honest - electric, and self driving cars becoming less and less exotic. Volkswagen is quick to adapt, and pick up latest technologies to put in their cars and sell them for cheap. They provide good price value ratio, and for most people that’s what counts.

Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn’t wanna go overboard 

**Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**

 The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.

  
**GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**

 Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining. 

**Uranium (BHP, NXE )** 

The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape.

## Falling Euro EV Sales / Shrinking EV Share

[Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-19/germany-s-slump-in-ev-sales-drags-on-europe-s-auto-market) 

> EV deliveries in the region’s biggest car market [(Germany)] fell 69% during August, fueling a 36% drop across the region, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said Thursday. [...] With the battery-car market share shrinking to 14% in August — down from just over 15% last year

> Across Europe, new-car registrations dropped 16.5% compared to a year ago to 755,717 million units last month with declines also in France and Italy. The UK was the only major market where EV sales rose, gaining 10.8%.

European plants are underutilized because they make more than they need. [From DW:](https://www.dw.com/en/volkswagens-crisis-how-can-europes-car-industry-survive/a-70231806)

> One in three European factories of carmaking behemoths like BMW, Mercedes, Stellantis, Renault and Volkswagen is underutilized. In some of their plants, less than half of the vehicles that could theoretically be produced are actually being made.

VW is planning to layoff 15K, possibly closing 2-3 plants in Germany (for the first time). Ending job security program that prevents layoffs through 2029.

## The Threat of Chinese Exports to US/Europe

Meanwhile, China is the new auto giant. [This graph of exports by country is from early 2024](https://i.imgur.com/nPAd2wh.jpeg)--China is the Japan of the 1980s. The threat of Chinese competition is so high that EU is considering 50% tariffs (currently 15% on Chinese EVs), while the US is at 100%. In past years, I've always heard that Chinese cars are junk. Junk cars wouldn't need to need to have their price doubled to keep consumers from buying them. In other countries, Chinese brands are taking over the nascent EV market: ""Chinese automakers accounted for 88% of the EV market in Brazil and 70% in Thailand in the first quarter of this year.""

In Europe, despite tariffs: ""Chinese carmakers' share of passenger car sales in Europe rose to 17% in the first seven months of 2024 from 12% a year earlier, according to data from automotive consultancy Inovev, and Chinese car exports have reached record highs this year."" [(Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-auto-suppliers-ev-makers-flood-major-trade-fair-germany-2024-09-10/).

## Shifts in China's Domestic Markets 

The Chinese automobile renaissance is killing foreign producers in China, yet another sign that these cars in China are actually comparable quality. 

> Foreign brands’ market share of Chinese auto sales is tracking at a record low of 37 per cent in the first seven months of 2024, down from 64 per cent in 2020, according to data from Automobility, a Shanghai consultancy. So far this year, US brands are down more than 23 per cent while Japanese, Korean and German carmakers have also suffered double-digit declines, the data showed. By contrast, sales of Chinese brands are up nearly 22 per cent with Chinese companies overwhelmingly dominating sales of the EV market.

## Technological Edge in EVs for China?

[Nearly 40% of Chinese auto sales are of EVs](https://i.imgur.com/cqX6jts.png) versus 10% for the US and 21% for Europe. Aren't the US/EU supposed to be championing the green revolution in autos? BYD had a 5% share of Chinese cars in 2022--today it's 20%.  That's a big threat to Tesla for instance, who gets 20% of its revenue from China.

## Possible Bull Case

So  is there a bull case for VW? Here is a [Sum of the Parts](https://x.com/StanphylCap/status/1832096596319727717) bull case for Volkswagen. VW owns stakes in Porche, Traton in addition to owning Audi, VW cars, Skoda, Seat, Cupra Lamborghini, Bentley and Ducati. I don't fully understand how the debt impacts the analysis here, though. OP claims the debt is held by a captive finance arm and fully secured by leased cars + non-recourse (only collateral can be pursued, nothing more).

## Closing Thoughts

How are European automakers going to handle the competitive threat of a new Chinese auto juggernaut along with massive fiscal support in the US (from the IRA)? Their energy prices face much higher spikes [than in the US and China](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliasferrerbreda/2023/09/21/energy-europes-big-disadvantage/). Labor unions are much more powerful in Europe, making cost cuts difficult. Autos are already a very difficult sector to invest in, but I suspect European cars brands may be uninvestible and they are rightfully cheap on a P/E basis (if earnings are even positive).

611,1b24tan,2024-02-28 12:23:13,Reddit's IPO - The most important details & red flags,"It has been a while since there was an exciting IPO, but finally, there is one. 

I went through the Reddit prospectus, and here's my summary of Reddit as a company, the IPO, and some of the red flags I saw.

&#x200B;

The post will be divided into the following segments:

**- Current business model**

\- **Future business model**

\- **Analysis of financial statements**

\- **Why IPO?**

**- The IPO strategy**

**- Sam Altman**

**- Valuation**

&#x200B;

**Current business model**

Reddit's primary revenue source is - advertising. In 2023, it accounted for 98% of the $804 million in revenue. The remaining 2% comes from Reddit premium subscriptions, as well as products within the user economy (Reddit Gold / Avatars).

Given the significance of the advertising revenue stream, let's focus on that. The simple formula that can be derived is: **Number of users** multiplied by **Average revenue per user**. 

These are the two most important numbers that any investor needs to focus on when analyzing almost any advertising business.

Let's start with the number of users. In an ideal world, we should know the exact number of users, and divide that with the potential user size. This will allow us to calculate the so-called ""penetration rate"". So, if the penetration rate is 10% for example, it indicates that the company has plenty of room to grow.

Reddit discloses two metrics: DAUq (Daily active uniques) and WAUq (Weekly active uniques). This could be seen as the first red flag. Here's why:

If we define the market size as users who are above the age of 14, that's over 270 million in the U.S.

The U.S. daily active uniques are 36 million. Hence, if we use these metrics, the penetration rate is about **13%**.

However, if we use the weekly active uniques, we get to a penetration rate of almost **50%** (131 million WAUq).

So, which one is it?

I'll argue that even the 50% is understated. Why? Because first of all, not everyone will be on Reddit, just as not everyone will be on any other platform. Second of all, there are users who use Reddit once every few months, when they need someone's advice or opinion. These, once in a while users are not taken into these metrics.

In theory, the company can innovate, and bring new features, that attract more users, and the average time spent per user increases. Given that the platform doesn't change too much over time, I'll argue that the platform applies only to a certain type of user and is getting close to the ceiling when it comes to growing within the U.S.

Internationally, on the other side, there is plenty of room to grow. However, as George Orwell said, ""All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others"".

This brings us to the 2nd part of the equation - average revenue per user.

The average U.S. user brings 4x more revenue than the average user from the rest of the world. So, although there is room to grow, it is less valuable.

&#x200B;

**Future business model**

This is a good short summary of Reddit's main income stream, but it is backward-looking, and there is one more thing that we need to take into account. Its data.

It is fair to say that the platform is one of the internet's largest archives of human experiences and conversations, and this data definitely has value. It can be used for various reasons, including, training large language models. Pretty much the same day as filing the prospectus, Reddit and Google announced a partnership, that is expected to be worth $60 million per year. This is 8% of its 2023 revenue and I believe this revenue stream - licensing data - is what will create all the hype around the company. 

Here's why I think that:

&#x200B;

**Analysis of financial statements**

Despite being around for 19 years, Reddit is still struggling to find its way to profitability and loses around $100m per year. It can be argued that the company is poorly managed, and it reminds me of Twitter prior to the acquisition of Elon Musk, when the R&D was incredibly high and couldn't be justified with the new features introduced by the platform.

Reddit's R&D for 2023 was $438 million (55% of revenue). Of course, this is lagging, as in many cases, the value created from it is somewhere in the future. However, this isn't something new. Reddit has historically had high R&D expenses. Whether this is justified or not, of course, you be the judge.

Its revenue growth in 2023 was 20%, which isn't too exciting and can be barely labeled as a growth company. Especially considering there's not much room to grow in the U.S. and its international growth is less valuable.

&#x200B;

The expectation is that the valuation will be above $5 billion. The company has over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities and no debt apart from leases. Meaning, that the valuation of the business is above $3.8 billion. 

I'd argue with the current business model and lack of profitability, this cannot be justified. Its future value is highly dependent on the success of data licensing, a revenue stream, that we have very little information on.

&#x200B;

**Why IPO?**

However, the question ""Why IPO?"" has not been answered yet. The company is losing $100m per year and has over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. This is sufficient to cover the losses for the foreseeable future. So, raising additional funds doesn't seem to be the main reason for the IPO.

Two reasons should be considered:

1. **Liquidity for the existing shareholders** \-  However, if the existing shareholders are pushing for this, it means they're not too optimistic about the company's future.
2. Executive compensation - The CEO, for example, has over 660k PRSUs (Performance-restricted share units) that are eligible to vest when the company attains a $5b market cap valuation.

In my opinion, if the current shareholders believe in the company, they would be better off if the company remained private. So far, I am not convinced that the IPO adds any value to the company.

Being a public company brings quite some costs. The list of all costs, that is disclosed in the prospectus is yet to be completed, and there are also going to be additional ongoing expenses for being a public company, that will be incurred every single year.

&#x200B;

**The IPO strategy**

The price of pretty much anything is a function of supply and demand. As Reddit doesn't need additional funds, I don't expect the company will issue too many additional shares. Rumors range from raising $100m to $750m. Now, if we focus on the demand, here's another red flag.

Qualified Reddit users and moderators will be invited to buy shares in the IPO, alongside other investors, through a directed share program. In my opinion, this is a psychological trick, making the users and moderators feel special so that they use this special offer to buy shares.

In addition, there will be shares offered through Fidelity Brokerage Services, SoFi, and Robinhood. So, if someone wants to buy into an IPO, they get a chance to do that. Basically, the goal is to increase demand as much as possible.

&#x200B;

**Sam Altman**

Entities affiliated with Sam Altman have 9.2% voting power. Yes, the  OpenAI Sam Altman.

Have you seen the licensing deal between OpenAI and Reddit?  
Me neither.

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

Anyway, one of the questions that many have is - Is Reddit going to be overvalued from the start? The answer to that question depends on your expectations for the data licensing model. Based on my estimates, the current advertising business model is worth around $1.7 billion.

Add the $1.2 billion of cash on top of it, and the valuation is close to $3 billion.

Of course, I could be wrong in my estimates, but it is quite clear that the advertising business doesn't explain the $5 billion + valuation.

So, is the data licensing revenue stream worth more than $2 billion? This is one of the main questions that needs to be answered. As there is no past information, it is also the key piece of the puzzle to create hype around the company. I would not be surprised if more data licensing information followed before the IPO, which further increases the hype around the company.

However, if Reddit can land many data licensing deals, then the $5 billion valuation can be justified.

&#x200B;

I'd love to read your thoughts about the IPO, your thoughts on how much the data licensing stream is worth, as well as if there is something else that you find important, that I missed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b24tan/reddits_ipo_the_most_important_details_red_flags/
612,1h0815y,2024-11-26 09:33:15,Rivian Receives Conditional Commitment for up to $6.6 Billion Loan from the U.S. Department of Energy,"RVINE, Calif., November 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American all-electric automaker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced it has received conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion (including $6 billion of principal and approximately $600 million of capitalized interest) to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design, development and manufacturing in the United States.

If finalized, the loan would support the construction of Rivian’s next facility in Stanton Springs North, near the city of Social Circle, Georgia, substantially expanding the company’s domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets. This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.

The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.

Rivian intends to build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity–supporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7,500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company’s future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2,000 expected full-time construction jobs that will utilize the region’s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal, Illinois, which have bolstered the local and regional economy.

""This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology,"" said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability. A robust ecosystem of U.S. companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the U.S. to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation.""

Rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the Stanton Springs Site, less than one hour’s drive from downtown Atlanta, employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities.

Over the history of the loan program, DOE has helped energize American EV manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry, including loans to General Motors and Tesla.

While this conditional commitment indicates DOE’s intent to finance the project, DOE and the company must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the Department of Energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. If finalized, the loan would be secured by all assets of the project and fixed assets and guarantees of the parent company, Rivian Automotive, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

616,1covdpg,2024-05-10 17:40:54,"Elon Musk backtracks on Supercharger network halt, says more chargers coming","Last week Tesla's CEO fired nearly the entire 500-member Supercharger team. Tesla's partners are demanding answers, with competitors waiting in the wings.

Leave it to Tesla CEO Elon Musk to add more chaos to a situation that he ostensibly created in the first place.

In a tweet on X early Friday morning, Musk addressed concerns many have had over his recent move to shrink down Tesla’s (TSLA) Supercharger team.

“Just to reiterate: Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year,” Musk wrote. “That’s just on new sites and expansions, not counting operations costs, which are much higher.”

Shortly thereafter, Musk also started a “Supercharger Community” on X, where members can discuss and share stories on the topic.

Whether Musk’s proclamation that Tesla is still heavily investing in the Supercharger is accurate or not is another story, but the industry, investors, and EV owners are seeking clarity and demanding answers.

Last week Musk and Tesla laid off nearly the entire Supercharger organization, which was responsible for the build-out of its best-in-class charging network. In the aftermath of the initial layoffs, Musk addressed the Supercharger news on X, stating that the network will grow at “a slower pace” for new locations.

Automakers like GM, Ford, Kia, Polestar, Stellantis, Honda, and others had signed up to access the Supercharger network, and incorporate Tesla’s NACS plug inlet in their future vehicles, under the promise that the Supercharger network would continue to grow at a steady pace.

Tesla was likely getting an earful from its NACS partners, questioning what they were getting exactly after signing deals to access the Supercharger network.

In addition, contractors and others working with Tesla on existing Supercharger projects were getting their emails bounced back with no feedback on what to do next. Tesla also apparently backed out of leases at four upcoming Supercharger sites in New York, per EV blog Electrek.

Charging network provider EVgo told Yahoo Finance that it was “actively engaged” in the development of the NACS network and was adding more locations to take advantage of Tesla’s move to backtrack its expansion.

EVgo competitor Blink Charging is also poised to move on the opportunity, claiming potential Supercharger customers contacted Blink about future orders in the wake of Tesla’s move.

Even oil and gas stalwarts like BP are moving in on Tesla. With its BP Pulse charging network, the company said it “is aggressively looking to acquire real estate to scale our network, which is a heightened focus following the recent Tesla announcement.”

The company’s top executive is even telling Tesla’s jilted partners to give him a ring.

“If there are stranded real estate partners who are looking for someone to call, they should feel free to pick up the phone and call me or look me up on LinkedIn,” BP Pulse Americas CEO Sujay Sharma told Bloomberg.

617,1gtwjvx,2024-11-18 04:22:41,Trump Team Is Seeking to Ease US Rules for Self-Driving Cars,"[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/)

  
TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said. 

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment. 

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtwjvx/trump_team_is_seeking_to_ease_us_rules_for/
618,1eld2in,2024-08-06 09:10:07,What's the deal with German automakers being so undervalued?,"German car companies like Mercedes, BMW, Porsche being valued at under 50 billion with P/E of around 5 seems massively illogical. Musk paid 44 billion for Twitter. Porsche's market cap is 30 billion. You could not even buy all the Porsches that are produced in a single year for 30 billion (roundabout 300k cars times 120k average price = 36 billion) let alone come anywhere close to buying the company. 

So how does it make sense that in theory, owning 51 % of the shares, which equals only about 15 billion worth right now, makes you the owner of the Porsche company? Of course this is in theory because you cannot just go and buy 51 % of the shares but you get the point.

As reference, Intel currently is still valued 4 times as much as Porsche and twice as much as Mercedes while basically being a company on lifeline supported by tax money while Mercedes released the first approved level 3 self-driving car (ahead of Tesla) so these companies aren't just sleeping on new tech and living off of past glory like Intel to be valued only around or under the 50 billion mark. But that's how they are valued.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1eld2in/whats_the_deal_with_german_automakers_being_so/

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ended September 28, 2024. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6 percent year over year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share of $0.97. Diluted earnings per share was $1.64,1 up 12 percent year over year when excluding the one-time charge recognized during the fourth quarter of 2024 related to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court’s State Aid decision.

“Today Apple is reporting a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “During the quarter, we were excited to announce our best products yet, with the all-new iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4, and remarkable features for hearing health and sleep apnea detection. And this week, we released our first set of features for Apple Intelligence, which sets a new standard for privacy in AI and supercharges our lineup heading into the holiday season.”

“Our record business performance during the September quarter drove nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing us to return over $29 billion to our shareholders,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “We are very pleased that our active installed base of devices reached a new all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty.”

Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on November 14, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 11, 2024.

626,1ftqqw0,2024-10-01 15:23:05,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|

|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time.

629,1ffw4rb,2024-09-13 14:29:17,Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-sharing trips in Austin and Atlanta ,"Uber announced Friday it is expanding its partnership with Alphabet’s Waymo to offer robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta beginning in early 2025. Shares of Uber jumped 5% on the news while Alphabet rose about 1%.

Uber riders in those cities can be matched with a driverless Waymo car for some trips, according to the companies. The rides will only be available through Uber’s app, unlike in San Francisco and Los Angeles where riders book through the Waymo app. A Waymo spokesperson said it had no plans to partner with Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The expansion comes as Uber faces investor pressure to step up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Tesla’s planned robotaxi event slated for Oct. 10. Shares of Uber have fallen 9% since the Tesla event was announced and are off 17% from their 52-week highs. 

It may also slow Waymo encroachment into Uber’s market share. An analysis from Bernstein estimated that, as of May 2024, Waymo’s 50,000 weekly paid rides made up approximately 2% of ride-sharing usage in San Francisco. Since then, Waymo has doubled its paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 a week, the company announced. 

“We’re thrilled to build on our successful partnership with Waymo, which has already powered fully autonomous trips for tens of thousands of riders in Phoenix,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a release. 

Uber’s initial agreement with Waymo in Phoenix also included autonomous Uber Eats deliveries in the city. The expansion into Austin and Atlanta won’t include Uber Eats at first, according to the Waymo spokesperson, but they’re exploring that possibility for the future. 

Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said, “We’ve been delighted at the positive feedback from our Waymo One riders to date, and we can’t wait to bring the comfort, convenience, and safety of the Waymo Driver to these cities in partnership with Uber.” 

The expansion into two more cities is another step in Uber’s advancement into the robotaxi space, after struggling to get a foothold and selling off its own self-driving division in 2020, now relying on partnerships with companies including Waymo, GM’s Cruise and the SoftBank-backed U.K. startup Wayve to gain ground. 

Uber shares dipped in August after the company announced a multiyear partnership with Cruise to offer autonomous rides through its app next year. Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski cited Cruise’s previous safety challenges as a part of the investor skepticism, along with now-fulfilled hopes for a partnership with Waymo instead. 

Waymo has rapidly made strides in the self-driving race. It currently offers robotaxi services to the public in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix. It has logged more than 22 million miles through June of this year, and last week, it released a report that argued its vehicles are safer than human drivers. It began testing driverless cars on Bay Area freeways with Google employees in August.

Some analysts were more hopeful for a potential Uber and Waymo expansion into San Francisco. But Atlanta and Austin, where Waymo has already begun testing, may still help sentiment.

634,1hy9eie,2025-01-10 17:14:34,"Contrarian alert: Uber’s missing the AI wave, yet it looks promising.","So, after Travis Kalanick got ousted, Dara Khosrowshahi stepped in and turned Uber from a “wartime” to a “peacetime” company. He cleaned up the culture mess, shoved aside long-term moonshots (like Uber’s self-driving unit) and put the company on a strict path to profitability (as expected from a former Wall Street banker).

Despite getting smacked by COVID and high interest rates, Uber tightened its belt, doubled down on demand-supply matchmaking, and came out profitable. Wall Street went nuts. Uber is now FCF-positive and aiming for even higher margins. 

**So what is Uber today?**

Dara says they’re laser-focused on nailing that perfect supply-demand match. Sure, they’re winning in mobility and they might tackle new verticals like Fiverr-style marketplaces. Sounds great, except they’re missing out on the biggest opportunity of our era, which is motherfucking **AI.**

Uber collects **11B trips** a year from **160M users**, racking up insane amounts of data (driver reviews, food reviews, social patterns across countless cities etc). This could’ve made them a self-driving powerhouse. But they ditched their autonomous unit in 2020 to cut costs, just as NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang now shows off new automotive processors and partnerships with Toyota, Aurora (who bought Uber’s AV unit), and Volvo. **Uber’s name is nowhere on that list!!!**

No matter how you spin it, a simple “supply-demand” marketplace could get overshadowed once autonomous vehicles go mainstream. Especially when you already own the infrastructure for ride-hailing, food delivery, scooters and bikes.

**Investors might be licking their chops (at least I would do it If I were them)** at two big plays:

1. **Pull a Reddit:** Sell anonymized data for LLM training and get lots of money, further increasing margins. Instantly, Uber gets an “AI play.” 
2. **Sell to Tesla or Google:** Supercharge someone else’s AV ambitions (as well as their foundation models) and get a fat premium in the process.

Meanwhile, the stock still looks undervalued. Uber’s **LTM P/FCF** is around **22.6x**, PEG is **under 1.0x** (Peter Lynch territory), and a Reverse DCF suggests they only need **9.2% revenue growth** (at \~12.4% margins) over 10 years to justify the current price. That’s totally doable.

Here’s how I see it playing out:

1. **Best case:** Tesla or Google acquires them this year and we get a solid premium payday. Probably a stock deal, but it’s still peanuts compared to Tesla and Google market caps. 
2. **Second best:** Uber pivots to selling AI training data. 
3. **Not bad either:** Uber dominates more human-driven marketplaces. 
4. **Base scenario:** They stick to mobility, keep expanding margins, and *maybe* bolt on third-party AVs .

This is complete BS argument, and for these people I have only one thing to say. Google was and is the king in Data, yet we have ChatGPT and Anthropics took them by surprised. They have fraction of data that google has, yet they are far better LLM model than Gemini. It clearly isn't about quantity of data, more so on quality and how  it is used to train your model.

Same thing for selfdriving, we literally have Waymo running since 2019, and now expanding to even more cities but people refuse to acknowledge. Tesla has no lead in AI, not in software or hardware. if you listened to TSLA's latest earning call, there was also no mention of dojo, and instead they kept bringing up about buying NVDA H100 to build super computer. This throws out any vertical integration argument as well.

I know people still like to drink Musk coolaid but this is not going to end well. And before you think I am one sour grape because the stock went up 12%, do check my comment history. I insisted in buying calls for yesterday's earning. But that doesn't change the fact, that tesla is going to be a dead money for a while. It IS a well run car company, with no debt and state of art manufacturing. Their only MOAT is the tesla's supercharger network. It should get higher multiple than traditional car companies no doubt.

636,1dtbnef,2024-07-02 03:01:21,"Salesforce shareholders reject compensation plan for CEO Marc Benioff, top execs ","Salesforce investors voted against the company’s compensation plan for top executives, after shareholder advisory groups raised concerns about equity awards granted to CEO Marc Benioff.

According to a regulatory filing on Monday, the resolution to approve the compensation received 339.3 million votes in favor and 404.8 million against at the annual meeting held on Thursday.

The board had urged shareholders to vote in favor of the resolution. But two shareholder advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, both recommended that investors vote down the measure.

For the 2024 fiscal year, Benioff received $39.6 million in total pay, up from $29.9 million in the prior year. While Benioff’s salary was flat at $1.55 million, he received additional stock and option awards and nonequity incentive plan compensation, according to the proxy statement. The most recent sum also included security fees that had not previously been invoiced to the company.

In January, the board’s compensation committee gave Benioff a second long-term equity award worth $20 million, in recognition of the company’s “successful transformation actions and strong financial performance in the fiscal year,” among other factors.

Glass Lewis wrote in its recommendation that “shareholders may reasonably be wary of the substantial discretionary equity grants” issued to Benioff in January, adding that there was a “lack of a fully convincing rationale” behind the grants.

Benioff was already among the largest holders of Salesforce, with a stake of over 2% valued at close to $6 billion. Glass Lewis said in its proxy paper that the additional performance-based restricted stock units and stock options were “unwarranted” because his interests were already aligned with that of shareholders.

The vote from the annual meeting is nonbinding.

“Our Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by our stockholders and will consider the outcome of this vote when making future executive compensation decisions,” Salesforce’s board said in the company’s proxy statement.

The company declined to comment.

Salesforce shares rose 67% in the 2024 fiscal year ended Jan. 31, the strongest performance since 2011.

Net income jumped to $4.1 billion in the fiscal year from $208 million a year earlier, while revenue increased 11% to $34.9 billion from $31.4 billion. In January 2023, Salesforce announced plans to lay off 10% of employees, after activist investors began buying up stakes and demanding a better mix of profit and growth. Salesforce said in February it would begin paying a dividend to shareholders.

Salesforce shares are off 2.6% year to date.

> BlackRock’s iShares is trying to appeal to investors who want to diversify beyond from the so-called Magnificent Seven. The firm launched the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT) this month. It doesn’t just hold the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. It’s made up of the 20 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. “What the iShares build ETFs are designed to do is to deliver a tool kit of simple solutions for investors to be able to capture the growth of some of the largest companies within the U.S. equity market today, but to do so in a broader and more diversified manner,” BlackRock’s Rachel Aguirre told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Monday.

> Aguirre, the firm’s head of U.S. iShares product, noted the ETF’s mission is to deliver an easy and accessible way to tap into the innovation of megacaps – “whether that be in the tech-heavy Nasdaq space or, more broadly, within the S&P [500].” The ETF, according to Aguirre, provides a way for investors worried about the concentration of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the S&P 500.

> On Thursday, the Magnificent Seven slid more than 3.5% as a group — losing around $615 billion in market cap. That’s equivalent to the size of JPMorgan Chase. However, the Magnificent Seven is still up about 43% so far year while the S&P 500 is up around 20% “It’s important for clients and investors to remember that there are split views on this topic. There are many investors who believe that the big will get bigger [and] that the winners will continue to win,” Aguirre said. “There’s also another side to this argument. There are many investors who believe that it’s actually a very worrisome time to continue investing in… mega-cap companies because of just their high valuations.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gh4zwd/blackrock_launches_etf_that_expands_beyond_the/
639,1bp6rv9,2024-03-27 16:54:55,"Amazon spends $2.75B on AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment","Amazon is making its largest outside investment in its three-decade history as it looks to gain an edge in the artificial intelligence race. 

The tech giant said it will spend another $2.75 billion backing Anthropic, a San Francisco-based startup that’s widely viewed as a frontrunner in generative artificial intelligence. Its foundation model and chatbot Claude competes with OpenAI and ChatGPT.

The companies announced an initial $1.25 billion investment in September, and said at the time that Amazon would invest up to $4 billion. Wednesday’s news marks Amazon’s second tranche of that funding.

Amazon will maintain a minority stake in the company and won’t have an Anthropic board seat, the company said. The deal was struck at the AI startup’s last valuation, which was $18.4 billion, according to a source. 

Over the past year, Anthropic closed five different funding deals worth about $7.3 billion — and with the new Amazon investment, the total exceeds $10 billion. The company’s product directly competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT in both the enterprise and consumer worlds, and it was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives and employees.

News of the Amazon investment comes weeks after Anthropic debuted Claude 3, its newest suite of AI models that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The company said the most capable of its new models outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.

“Generative AI is poised to be the most transformational technology of our time, and we believe our strategic collaboration with Anthropic will further improve our customers’ experiences, and look forward to what’s next,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and AI at AWS.

Amazon’s move is the latest in a spending blitz among cloud providers to stay ahead in the AI race. And it’s the second update in a week to Anthropic’s capital structure. Late Friday, bankruptcy filings showed crypto exchange FTX struck a deal with a group of buyers to sell the majority of its stake in Anthropic, confirming a CNBC report from last week.

The term generative AI entered the mainstream and business vernacular seemingly overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAI’s ChatGPT first showcased the tech’s ability to produce human-like language and creative content in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has said more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted the platform, spanning industries such as financial services, legal applications and education.

Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services don’t want to be caught flat-footed.

It’s a symbiotic relationship. As part of the agreement, Anthropic said it will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also use Amazon chips to train, build and deploy its foundation models. Amazon has been designing its own chips that may eventually compete with Nvidia. 

Microsoft has been on its own spending spree with a high-profile investment into OpenAI. Microsoft’s OpenAI bet has reportedly jumped to $13 billion as the startup’s valuation has topped $29 billion. Microsoft’s Azure is also OpenAI’s exclusive provider for computing power, which means the startup’s success and new business flows back to Microsoft’s cloud servers.

Google, meanwhile, has also backed Anthropic, with its own deal for Google Cloud. It agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, comprising a $500 million cash infusion, with another $1.5 billion to be invested over time. Salesforce is also a backer.

Anthropic’s new model suite, announced earlier this month, marks the first time the company has offered “multimodality,” or adding options like photo and video capabilities to generative AI.

But multimodality, and increasingly complex AI models, also lead to more potential risks. Google recently took its AI image generator, part of its Gemini chatbot, offline after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media.

Anthropic’s Claude 3 does not generate images; instead, it only allows users to upload images and other documents for analysis.

“Of course no model is perfect, and I think that’s a very important thing to say upfront,” Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei told CNBC earlier this month. “We’ve tried very diligently to make these models the intersection of as capable and as safe as possible. Of course there are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time.”

Amazon’s biggest venture bet before Anthropic was electric vehicle maker Rivian, where it invested more than $1.3 billion. That too, was a strategic partnership. 

These partnerships have been picking up in the face of more antitrust scrutiny. A drop in acquisitions by the Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla — has been offset by an increase in venture-style investing, according to Pitchbook.

AI and machine-learning investments from those seven tech companies jumped to $24.6 billion last year, up from $4.4 billion in 2022, according to Pitchbook. At the same time, Big Tech’s M&A deals fell from 40 deals in 2022 to 13 last year. 

“There is a sort of paranoia motivation to invest in potential disruptors,” Pitchbook AI analyst, Brendan Burke, said in an interview. “The other motivation is to increase sales, and to invest in companies that are likely to use the other company’s product — they tend to be partners, more so than competitors.”

Big Tech’s spending spree in AI has come under fire for the seemingly circular nature of these agreements. By investing in AI startups, some, including Benchmark’s Bill Gurley have accused the tech giants of funneling cash back to their cloud businesses, which in turn, may show up as revenue. Gurley described it as a way to “goose your own revenues.”

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is taking a closer look at these partnerships, including Microsoft’s OpenAI deal and Google and Amazon’s Anthropic investments. What’s sometimes called “round tripping” can be illegal — especially if the aim is to mislead investors. But Amazon has said that this type of venture investing does not constitute round tripping.

FTC Chair Lina Khan announced the inquiry during the agency’s tech summit on AI, describing it as a “market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers.”

640,1hkkzy9,2024-12-23 10:28:14,Honda and Nissan officially start merger talks ,"Honda and Nissan have officially begun merger talks, partially aimed at competing with Tesla and Chinese companies in the ev space. If completed the merger would make the third largest auto company in the world. The two companies currently have an MoU for the proposed merger. The tentative merger deal is looking to close June of 2025. The leadership would be largely decimated by Honda, and could include a reciprocal manufacturing agreement to use one another’s plants. 



Nissan has been struggling under heavy debt and lackluster revenue and most recently announced significant layoffs after a 93% profit plunge. Honda can be seeing this as more of an acquisition than a merger as they aim to swoop in and help Nissan achieve a “v shaped recovery” from their recent downturn. 



The completed merger could reset the stage for major auto makers and present serious competition for American car companies. Looking forward to watching this develop and see what the impacts will be. Honda does have some U.S. manufacturing but also has plants in Mexico, Canada, and Japan making discussions of what if any tariffs they could face another piece of the landscape.

Everything below this line was written before the release of P&D numbers \~

TSLA is going to release its 2024Q2 P&D numbers in the next couple of hours, WS analysts think that total delivery could reach 438,019 (vs 466,140, i.e. around 6% YoY drop).

In my opinion, 438K is still far too high based on continuous checking shared by a lot of non-WS analysts - which is supported by the data regularly released in Mainland China, Europe and the United States. The educated estimates should be ranging from 415K to 420K, implying at least 9% YoY decline.

Recall in January 2024's investor call that Mr. CEO was saying TSLA is between two major growth waves while no further guidance was provided (very tricky to be honest), does it mean ""low growth"" or actually ""no growth""?

Unrealized losses in the US banking system are once again on the rise, according to new numbers from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

In its Quarterly Banking Profile report, the FDIC [says](https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/fdic-quarterly-banking-profile-first-quarter-2024) banks are now saddled with more than half a trillion dollars in paper losses on their balance sheets, due largely to exposure to the residential real estate market.

Unrealized losses represent the difference between the price banks paid for securities and the current market value of those assets.

Although banks can hold securities until they mature without marking them to market on their balance sheets, unrealized losses can become an extreme liability when banks need liquidity.

*“Unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities increased by $39 billion to $517 billion in the first quarter. Higher unrealized losses on residential mortgage-backed securities, resulting from higher mortgage rates in the first quarter, drove the overall increase. This is the ninth straight quarter of unusually high unrealized losses since the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates in first quarter 2022.”* 

The FDIC also says that the number of lenders on its Problem Bank List rose last quarter. According to the agency, these banks are on the brink of insolvency due to financial, operational, or managerial weakness or a combination of such issues.

*“The number of banks on the Problem Bank List, those with a CAMELS composite rating of ‘4’ or ‘5’ increased from* ***52 in fourth quarter 2023 to 63 in first quarter 2024****. The number of problem banks represented 1.4% of total banks, which was within the normal range for non-crisis periods of 1% to 2% of all banks.*  ***Total assets held by problem banks increased $15.8 billion to $82.1 billion during the quarter.”*** 

While the FDIC says that the health of the US banking system is **at no imminent risk**, it warns that persistent inflation, volatile market rates and geopolitical concerns continue to put pressure on the industry.

*“These issues could cause credit quality, earnings, and liquidity challenges for the industry. In addition, deterioration in certain loan portfolios, particularly office properties and credit card loans, continues to warrant monitoring. These issues, together with funding and margin pressures, will remain matters of ongoing supervisory attention by the FDIC.”* ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1d7oro1/fdic_says_63_lenders_on_brink_of_insolvency_but/

648,1gv6hj0,2024-11-19 20:04:07,"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

Happy investing!",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gv6hj0/palantir_short_thesis_and_an_analysis_of_its/
649,1e0ds09,2024-07-11 02:13:48,"RIVN, What are your thoughts?","I've been paying attention to Rivian (RIVN) and I'm holding for the long term. Historical performance has been poor, they IPO'd way over valued to raise funds, but what they're doing is expensive. It's no news that they're hemorrhaging money, citing a loss of $40,000 per vehicle sold (down from $67,000 last year). But in the last 3 months they've had some very promising announcements.

During the recent investor day webinar they talked about how Gen 1 was all about proof of concept, but now they're moving onto Gen 2 which is about manufacturing efficiency. They detailed how they reduced components, steps and fasteners to decrease production and assembly costs. It all sounds very good. In addition they just entered a deal with VW for $5 Billion and all Rivian is supplying to VW is software. It's a stepped plan, $1B up front and additional investments based on performance.

If they reduce manufacturing costs as they predict, and lower sale price as they promised, I'm thinking this stock could be ripe for big growth. They're the only company competing directly with Tesla, and on the consumer side, it's going well. I doubt we'll ever see a RIVN selling at comparable prices to TSLA, but I could see them over $100 in a few years if they continue to make advancements.

651,1f7513x,2024-09-02 12:02:43,BYD sales hit a record in August despite broader China EV slowdown ,"Chinese electric car giant BYD sold a record number of passenger vehicles in August, with sales of hybrids growing faster than those of battery-only cars.

The company said August sales rose by 30% year-on-year to 370,854 passenger cars.

Its sales of battery-only cars rose by nearly 12%, while hybrid-powered vehicle sales surged by 48% to account for just under two-thirds of BYD cars sold last month.

In contrast, several new energy vehicle startups saw a dip in deliveries last month.

Li Auto, best known for its range-extender vehicles, reported 48,122 deliveries in August, down from a record 51,000 in July.

Aito, which uses Huawei technology, said it delivered 31,216 cars last month, down by more than 10,000 vehicles from the prior month. Huawei is selling the Aito trademark and patents to automaker Seres for 2.5 billion yuan ($352.5 million).

Lower-priced cars hitting the market

Nio said it delivered 20,176 cars in August, down slightly from July but above 20,000 for a fourth-straight month.

The company’s lower-priced brand Onvo opened 105 stores on Sunday as it prepares to begin for deliveries for its first car, the L60 SUV, this month. Nio is scheduled to report earnings on Friday.

Xpeng reported 14,036 car deliveries in August, its best month for the year so far.

The company said on Friday it began some deliveries of its newly launched, mass market Mona M03 electric car that sells for the equivalent of less than $20,000 in China. It was not clear whether those M03 deliveries were included in the total figure Xpeng reported.

Geely-backed Zeekr reported a month-on-month increase to 18,015 deliveries in August, but that was down from 20,206 deliveries in June.

Undercutting Tesla and going global

Zeekr on Friday said it would launch its first SUV this month with a price more than $1,400 lower than Tesla’s Model Y. The U.S.-listed Chinese company said it aims to deliver the SUV globally by the end of this year, but did not specify which countries or regions.

BYD said it sold 31,451 cars overseas last month, pushing the year-to-date total to 264,869 and above the 242,765 cars it sold abroad for all of last year.

If BYD keeps up its average monthly overseas sales pace through the end of December, the company will sell just under 400,000 cars outside China this year, according to CNBC calculations.

Xiaomi only said it delivered more than 10,000 cars in August for a third-straight month. In mid-July, CEO Lei Jun said the company aimed to deliver 100,000 units of its SU7 electric sedan by the end of November.

That indicates Xiaomi needs to deliver an average of at least 16,000 cars a month from August to November, according to CNBC calculations of reported data.

The smartphone company began mass deliveries of the SU7 in April at a price about $4,000 less than Tesla’s Model 3.

INTC - Semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse. Still has a majority in data center and pc CPU space. I do agree that they fell behind TSMC and Samsung in terms of process leadership and don't have a serious product offering in the GPU space that can take on Nvidia H100 (Gaudi 3 seems like a good competitor). And Pat Gelsinger is trying hard to bring it back on track. They have 18A process node on track to hit HVM production in 2025(?), US government is funding their fab expansion plans, Foundry is slowly winning customer, and for the next few years, compute is the new oil. Everything seems to be inline for INTC to go up like AMD and NVDA. But no, it always drops.  
  
TSLA - Eccentric owner who is more interested in peddling conspiracy theories on X that he bought on a whim. FSD was a long lost pipe dream, which never seems to be working fine , and current version has its own kinks. EV is becoming an extremely competitive market everyday with new entrants and an ongoing price war. Cybertruck was late by 2-3(?) years and has. IDK if Roadster will ever happen in this decade, Tesla Semi is another thing which seemed nice on paper but idk if it's ever really gonna happen. News reports claimed that Musk cancelled Model2. But again claims TSLA is gonna make a cheaper model ( which would probably cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales; and lets be honest - no one knows if and when that's actually coming on the roads).  
  
Can anyone explain why is the market so bullish about TSLA even after reporting lower EPS, 9% drop in revenue, and is ready to eat his words about the cheaper model like its God's truth itself, while INTC drops like a rock on the first opportunity, even though Semiconductors are the bedrock of AI and EV growth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cc3dtf/intc_vs_tsla_trying_to_understand_market_sentiment/

* Walmart (digital is coming, digital is coming since 2010)

658,1ga9gk5,2024-10-23 12:35:32,Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?,"We believe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2-trillion figure now – potentially becoming the world’s most valuable company by a huge margin – as its often-overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This would take the stock to over $500 a share. Here’s why.

Fact: Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10,000 to over 100,000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.

The growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive

Case in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let’s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That’s about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we’re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.

But wait… there is more to the growth story

If Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel.

In fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.

Investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential – it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn’t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies.

But wait aren’t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?

Yes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor’s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.

Waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don’t forget Google’s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That’s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.

The best part?

These are self-driving cars – no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren’t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.

If Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that’s a neat $150 billion in profits. What’s that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company’s market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.

To be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time – quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.

The move follows a near 8% fall in Tencent’s U.S. depository receipts on Wall Street.

Other Chinese companies added to the list included battery maker CATL, which is part of the supply chain for automakers such as Ford and Tesla.

CATL shares, which fell as much as 5.6%, were last down 2.8% in Shenzhen.

The National Defence Authorization Act of 2024 says that the DoD will be prohibited from procuring goods or services directly from entities on the list in June 2026, and indirectly from June 2027.

In response to the decision, Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was “clearly a mistake.”

“We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business,” the company added.

CATL also called the designation “a mistake” in a response, saying it “is not engaged in any military related activities.”

The U.S. has taken aim at Chinese tech companies in its bid to restrict transfer of high-end technologies to China. Last year, it revoked certain licenses to sell chips to China’s Huawei in May and unveiling new sweeping export controls on critical technologies in September, including quantum computing and semiconductor goods.

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security said companies must apply for a license if they want to sell certain advanced computing semiconductors or related manufacturing equipment to China.

DIS is up 3% today; up 30% YTD," Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar upgraded the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and boosted his price target on shares to **$135 from the prior $95**. The move implies roughly 15% upside based on current trading levels of about **$120** a share.

Venkateshwar argued better-than-expected free cash flow and earnings guidance, coupled with ""tactical tailwinds"" such as the Hollywood strikes, Hulu's consolidation, and cost cuts, have helped buoy investor confidence. 

Meanwhile, ""*the propensity among media investors to be long Disney, has resulted in the stock outperforming broader markets meaningfully thus far this year, at a pace faster than we anticipated*.""

The stock has been on a tear since the start of the year, up more than **30%** compared to the S&P 500's 10% rise over that same time period.

It's a significant turnaround for the company after its stock price hit multiyear lows last year. The media giant has been grappling with challenges that include a declining linear TV business, slower growth in its parks business, and losses in its streaming business. A heated proxy battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz has also clouded the company's outlook.

But Venkateshwar argued Disney's next phase ""*may be more impactful as a number of turnaround elements still remain work in progress and may manifest more in numbers starting next year*.""

In his bull case, the analyst said **sooner-than-expected streaming profitability** could serve as a boon to the stock price.

*""We expect Disney streaming to break even potentially a quarter or two earlier than company guidance of Q4 2024*,"" he explained. ""*This is in part driven by the tailwinds from cost cuts over the last few quarters and recent price increases*.""

Venkateshwar said he believes Disney will likely achieve streaming margins ""*that are better than Netflix*,"" estimating potential margins in the **25% to 30% range**, ""*which is not too different from where linear margins today are*.""

Other ""*upside narrative surprises*"" could include **ESPN's** yet-to-be-announced streaming partners for its over-the-top service, set to debut sometime in fall 2025, in addition to a refocused attention on long-term **succession** plans post-proxy battle.

Conversely, the analyst's bear case calls out declining non-sports TV viewership as linear network revenue falls amid increased cord cutting. Streaming, although a potential positive, could also be a net negative if subscriber growth does not pick up and pricing headwinds hit revenue growth.

663,1hfldj9,2024-12-16 15:18:27,From GPU to ASIC: Broadcom to capture NVDA  market share!,"Broadcom Surge Highlights the Importance of AI

Let’s start with some expert opinions I read over the weekend about Broadcom’s impressive rally views I completely agree with

At the hardware level, training costs are skyrocketing, limiting participation to a few CSP (cloud service providers) that can afford it.     As economies of scale see diminishing returns, these companies are shifting their strategies toward customer acquisition, commercialization, and retention—similar to Microsoft’s current approach.     With growing focus on model deployment and revenue generation, inference is bound to take center stage.     Open source models are becoming more valuable, enabling AI application developers to focus on building apps rather than training models from scratch.     It’s akin to the role Linux played during the cloud operating system boom.

The traditional scaling laws based on data are nearing a bottleneck.     We’re likely approaching the end of the pretraining era, with the future pointing towards the ""Agent and Reason"" age.

Here’s the key takeaway: Broadcom predicts that by 2027, its three largest existing clients (likely ByteDance, Google, and Meta) will deploy over one million arithmetic card units.     Additionally, two more clients are undergoing validation, potentially driving $60–90 billion in AI-related revenue.    That said, expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest.

This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation.   NVIDIA, which currently dominates with over 75% of the arithmetic card market, may see its lead challenged.     Broadcom’s ASIC solutions and NVIDIA’s GPUs could eventually share the market.    Once AI models stabilize, ASIC—being application-specific—could offer a significant cost advantage over general purpose GPU.

For major cloud providers, the massive capital expenditures have sparked criticism from shareholders.     At this point, these companies must demonstrate revenue growth to justify the spending.

As I write this, AVGO  is soaring again.     Broadcom rise was anticipated, but the market sentiment is electrifying.     Investors are desperately hunting for the next NVDA.     After cashing out Tesla last week, I thought Monday might bring a big move for Tesla.     Instead, Broadcom stole the spotlight.     While Tesla did rise, it couldn’t match Broadcom momentum.

Thats why i find it ironic his stock is the last to rally and it should be the mother of all come backs.

List of things going for TSLA into the second half of the year.

-pay package approved, now incorporated in TX, a massive hurdle out of the way

-Optimus robot. Wouldn't be surprised if there was a Iron man suit in the works (probably a top secret project?)

-License approved to test FSD is China

-FSD 12.4.1 release soon.

-Robo taxi announcement less than two month away(August 8th). RIP $Uber

-Model 3 Long Range now qualifies for the $7,500 tax credit. This will boost $ales.

-GM, Toyota, Honda and Ford cutting their production on EV's gives Telsa the opportunity to take more market share. More Tesla's on the road? More Robo taxi'$ to operate. More people using robo taxi, no need to buy a car from GM or Ford or Toyota.

-Master Plan Part 4 (Release date TBD)

-New products in the pipeline. They will certainly bring back the $25K car.

-Europe imposed a massive tarriff on Chinese made EV's. Good for Telsa.

-USA tariff on Chinese cars? 100%!!! , no competition from china here.

-Expansion in India is certain, just a matter of when.

The big short: Tesla is one of the most shorted stock in the market(Dollar Volume Sold Short$18.04 billion) with 1.1 days to cover. Tesla has been know to have massive +$30-$40 days, the faster shorts cover the faster we go to $280, my PT.

TSLA reminds me of Apple a few months ago trading at low $170's with not much excitement, now its near $220.

I have TSLA $205 call for July 26, i fully expect TSLA to reach the moon before the Robo taxi release. The time may be running out to get cheap calls.

666,1bqjpyn,2024-03-29 08:00:32,You're going to lose your shirt betting on Ev's,"Over the past few years, I have seen this sub (among many others) buy into the EV hype and try and justify the insane valuations that some EV companies are trading at. There are a couple points that I would like to make, and I would love to have a discussion with anybody who would like to.

* The top auto manufactures have a combined 2.7 trillion in revenue, 215 billion in earnings, and 2.2 trillion in market cap. Meaning the ENTIRE (or at least vast majority) of the auto manufacturing industry has a P/E of 10, and a P/B of .81.

\-Your favorite EV stock is trading at a P/E of 42 and a P/B of 8.22, meaning that to justify the valuation of Tesla, they would need to have 4.2 X the earnings and 10X the revenue of the auto manufacturing industry as a whole long term. I didn't write this post to single out Tesla, but it was hard to include P/E of other EV manufacturers because virtually none of them have positive earnings.

&#x200B;

For frame of reference, it's also worth noting that generally the PE ratio of the automotive industry is about 7-8, meaning that the industry as a whole (not just EV companies) could be overvalued. There's an argument to be made about potentially increasing margins due to the changes in the manufacturing process (EV's will have better margins) and technological advances justifying a higher P/E ratio across the board, but in the short term, getting those technological advances put in place is going to cost auto manufacturers a ton of money (should they choose to implement them). Tesla and the other EV manufacturers have an advantage when it comes to this, because they've committed to EV's only and don't have to worry about manufacturing ICE and EV at the same time or building the infrastructure to rollout EV's largescale. However, the traditional ICE manufacturers are going to follow the money, and if the money is in EV's, they will gladly lose money in the short term for earnings in the long term. We are already seeing this with virtually EVERY major auto manufacturer developing an EV.

The Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, etc investors presupposition that these companies are going to surpass traditional ICE manufacturers because they manufactured EV's first makes zero logical sense, and if you look at the history of ""disruptive innovation"" (as the guru of the hour calls it), it's almost never the first companies that disrupt an industry that are the most successful long term. The EV only companies have never been in a better position for market share than they were in the past, given that the traditional ICE companies are competing with them in EV's now.

The EV investors are also presupposing that the world will be moving to EV's only, which I don't believe will happen. There is certainly a reality in which the majority of new vehicles being bought are EV's, but there is also one in which they will not. There has been a lot of talk by politicians about EV mandates (these keep getting pushed back but are apparently still going to happen) but in the real world, there are a ton of people who prefer ICE vehicles and would not drive an EV. There will probably be a battle between the left and the right about these mandates and your guess as to what happens with that is as good as mine.

&#x200B;

Also, keep in mind that a move to EV's doesn't inherently mean more money for manufacturers. People aren't going to be buying more cars just because they switched from ICE to EV. These stocks will most likely do what they've always done and largely grow near the rate of the economy or slightly lag behind it. I'm not sure what Reddit's obsession with low margin, labor intensive industries is, but there are much better investments to put your money into.

&#x200B;

If you REALLY want to bet on EV's, find a traditional manufacturer at a good valuation that's betting on EV's. Volkswagen is a good one in my opinion.

669,1b3xvkb,2024-03-01 16:04:21,"Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely to be over","Derek Horstmeyer(repost)

*Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.*  
  
*To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.*  
  
*The final list of named trends we researched was:*  
  
*-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.*  
  
*-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.*  
  
*-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.*  
  
*-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.*  
  
*-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.*  
  
*-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.*  
  
*-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.*  
  
*-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce*  
  
*Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.*  
  
*From first mention*  
  
*Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.*  
  
*For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.*  
  
*The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.*  
  
*Worth the ride, until...*  
  
*But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.*  
  
*Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.*  
  
*When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.*  
  
*On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.*  
  
*All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b3xvkb/once_a_hot_stockmarket_trend_has_a_name_its_best/

671,1hawqbu,2024-12-10 07:46:46,Uber vs Everyone,"Alright unless you been living under a rock you heard or seen some videos of self driving vehicles be it waymo or tesla. The future of self driving vehicles is not a question of if at this point but when .
My question to you is this - how do you see uber play out in this changing fat environment. In your view do you see uber benefiting or losing from the rise of AV brought in by smaller and bigger companies.

Here is my take and I’m also not fully clear (I think the CEO needs to come out and clarify clearly their path and their different partnership goals).

Uber clearly wants to be a software company, the biggest aggregator of all mobility needs. They spent like crazy to be number 1 in travel. They spent like crazy during Covid to be the number 1 food delivery service. They spending like crazy on grocery delivery from what I notice and they eye to grow their freight business.

All their investments and actions points towards the aggregator strategy , from offloading their own self driving decision to Aurora to investing in all kinds of different startup from Serv robotics to Aurora (25% ownership) and companies in India, Asia and Latin America.

Can this strategy back fire? It could, however let’s ask , what does Google want? Google up until this point was mainly a software company, yes they produce their own pixel phones but I believe their main competitor is not Uber but Tesla. Google might be expanding their taxi service but is the end goal for them to be a global taxi company? I think not. There is much more profit in expanding the waymo service up until they prove that their software reached maturity. At that point Google will lease that software to any car manufacturer for a price, growing revenue in speeds that they won’t be able to match staying exclusive, hence the Tesla competitor. In the scenario that they lease/sell their software to any car manufacturer, it won’t be the end of the road for Uber because at worst case they can purchase a fleet of cars to continue their operations and supplement their other AV partners.

Now let’s assume waymo stays exclusive and Google interested to be a taxi company, meaning their partnership with Uber will end and they essentially going to compete with Uber. In this case, uber investments in Aurora Innovation might come helpful, they can re-acquire Aurora and their tech for whatever it’s worth and build on top of it. They can use their large cash flow to acquire a smaller AV company that struggles to compete with the big players and build on it. In both scenarios uber has a way out, as long as they don’t lay on their stomach blinded by short term profits (think BlackBerry in early 2000) and make sure to pivot at the right moment (if aggregator role dont workout, time to go shopping for small AV).

This is how I see it, I will be happy for anyone to challenge this view because sometime we all get blinded by our own biases.

*Chinese EV startups Xpeng and Nio announced car purchase subsidies Monday of 20,000 yuan ($2,800) and 10,000 yuan each, respectively. Nio said the promotional deal followed the Chinese government’s policy efforts to promote consumption with trade-ins.*

*The price reductions come as growth of new energy vehicles in the world’s largest auto market shows signs of slowing. Penetration of battery and hybrid-powered passenger cars has surpassed more than one third of new cars sold in China, according to the China Passenger Car Association.*

*Li Auto, most of whose cars come with a fuel tank to extend driving range, said Monday it delivered 28,984 cars in March. While up from February, the figure is below Li Auto’s recent delivery streak. The company in late March cut its first quarter delivery estimate by more than 20,000 vehicles.*

*Around the same time, Nio also trimmed its first quarter forecast by a few thousand cars. The company said Monday it delivered 11,866 cars in March.*

*Xpeng delivered even fewer cars last month, at 9,026 vehicles.*

*In contrast, Huawei’s new energy car brand Aito said it delivered 31,727 cars in March.*

*BYD remained the industry giant with 139,902 battery-powered passenger cars sold in March, and 161,729 hybrid vehicles sold during that time. BYD’s total passenger car sales last month rose by nearly 14% from a year ago.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bttdim/xiaomi_shares_pop_16_after_the_chinese_smartphone/

The Detroit automaker plans to “realign its autonomous driving strategy” to focus on advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous systems for use in personal vehicles instead, and it will combine the majority-owned Cruise LLC and GM technical teams.

This summer, the Detroit automaker said it would indefinitely delay production of the Origin autonomous vehicle as its Cruise self-driving unit attempted to relaunch operations. At that point, Cruise began to focus on using the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt for development of autonomous vehicles since then.

In the U.S. Alphabet-owned Waymo has begun to operate commercial robotaxi services across several major metro areas while GM-owned Cruise has faltered. Chinese autonomous vehicle makers including Pony.ai and WeRide have rolled out in overseas markets as well.

Tesla, meanwhile, showed off design concepts for a self-driving Cybercab at an event in October. Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software in its vehicles as “partially automated driving systems,” which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025.

SoftBank-funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, and Amazon-owned Zoox is also testing its autonomous vehicles, which do not feature steering wheels, in several U.S. cities including San Francisco.

683,1axl48j,2024-02-22 23:21:26,Rivian and Lucid shares plunge after weak EV earnings reports,"Shares of electric vehicle makers Rivian and Lucid plummeted Thursday after the companies reported disappointing results and stagnant production in their fourth-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday.

Rivian shares plunged about 25% and Lucid’s stock sank almost 17% on Thursday.

Rivian forecast it will make 57,000 vehicles in 2024, slightly less than the 57,232 vehicles the company produced last year. Lucid said it expects to make 9,000 vehicles in 2024, about 7% more than the 8,428 vehicles it made in 2023.

Rivian’s revenue of $1.32 billion for the quarter beat Wall Street estimates, but its net loss per share of $1.36 was worse than expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. The company also announced Wednesday it would cut 10% of its workforce.

“Our business is not immune to existing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, which has negatively impacted demand,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said on Wednesday’s earnings call.

Lucid reported lower-than-expected revenue of $157.2 million for the quarter, and its net loss of 30 cents per share was in line with estimates, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG.

Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said the macroeconomic environment and higher interest rates also affected the company. He said the company has had to learn to operate in new locations, such as Saudi Arabia, with different market dynamics.

Though companies have invested billions of dollars in EVs, sales have grown more slowly than expected. EVs made up 6.9% of sales heading into December, or roughly 976,560 units, up 1.7 percentage points compared with total sales in 2022. 

Rivian and Lucid make up a fraction of EV sales compared with the industry leader, Tesla. A Cox Automotive analysis found that Rivian accounted for just over 4% of EV sales in 2023, while Lucid made up 0.5%. Tesla controlled about 55% of the market.

Shares of Rivian have dropped about 40% in the past year and have fallen 85% from their initial public offering price of $78 a share in November 2021. Lucid’s stock is down about 70% in the past year and has dropped more than 75% from its IPO price of $14 a share in October 2021.

Rivian and Lucid weren’t the only EV producers Wall Street was watching Thursday.

Electric truck maker Nikola reported worse-than-expected revenue and a slightly better-than-expected loss per share in its earnings Thursday. The stock traded about flat Thursday, and has lost nearly all of its value since it hit an all-time high of $93.99 in June 2020.

Stock in S&P 500 is considered a safe option still in my opinion.

But companies like Apple and Tesla, Microsoft are they likely to keep rising considering we as a civilization have hit the top of the pyramid in terms of advancing technology, Nothing is really new anymore, so you're bascially profiting from inflation from the need of people of these monopolic companies and markets, basically you're profiting from the Hype of these companies. but China is slowly stealing the market away from the states and european markets, and we can clearly see that in creating Electric Cars, BYD for example, it's damn succesful, and growing to be even more succseful. So is there a risk of them stealing other markets as well, therefore, making companies like Apple and Microsoft risky to invest in long term now. whoever invested in those companies in the past 5 years benefited greatly but now i see it's hit the top. or did it not? and it will still rise and is still safe?

**US seeks answers from Tesla in Autopilot recall probe**

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-seeks-answers-tesla-autopilot-recall-probe-2024-05-07](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-seeks-answers-tesla-autopilot-recall-probe-2024-05-07)

&#x200B;

*U.S. auto safety investigators are seeking detailed answers and documents from Tesla in a probe into the automaker's December recall of more than 2 million vehicles to install new Autopilot safeguards.*

*The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said last month it was investigating after receiving reports of 20 crashes involving vehicles that had the Autopilot software updates installed under Tesla's recall. The agency's letter said it had identified ""several concerns"", regarding the recall.*

*Tesla said in December its largest-ever recall covering 2.03 million U.S. vehicles - or nearly all of its vehicles on U.S. roads - was to better ensure drivers pay attention when using its advanced driver assistance system.*

*The NHTSA recall investigation covers models Y, X, S, 3 and Cybertruck vehicles in the U.S. equipped with Autopilot produced between the 2012 and 2024 model years.*

*Tesla, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has said repeatedly that Autopilot does not make vehicles self-driving and is intended for use with a fully attentive driver who is prepared to take over and has hands on the steering wheel.*

*NHTSA said it had sent Tesla an information request letter, which was made public on Tuesday, seeking details of the recall and documents by July 1.*

*NHTSA wants comparative data from Tesla on the performance of vehicles after receiving the recall including the number of hands on wheel warnings issued.*

*The agency said it had concerns after those 20 crashes as well as results from preliminary NHTSA tests of updated vehicles following Tesla's five-part recall remedy.*

*One issue under investigation is Tesla's recall allows drivers to set how they activate Autopilot by either allowing a single-pull or double-pull of the drive stalk.*

*NHTSA's letter said the single-pull activation of Autopilot ""is not the default setting on vehicles that received the remedy in the field"" and testing ""showed it was possible to make this change while driving.""*

*Tesla has also made additional updates to reduce crashes including high speed captive turn lane collisions that are not part of the recall.*

*NHTSA said it ""will assess the timing and driving factors behind these updates, their impacts on subject vehicle field performance, and Tesla’s basis for not including them"".*

*Last month, NHTSA said it found evidence that ""Tesla’s weak driver engagement system was not appropriate for Autopilot’s permissive operating capabilities"" and that this results in a ""critical safety gap.""*

*NHTSA said during its Autopilot safety probe launched in August 2021 that it had identified at least 13 Tesla crashes involving at least one death and many more involving serious injuries in which ""foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.""*

*NHTSA noted Tesla's December recall ""allows a driver to readily reverse"" the software update.*

**Elon Musk proposed to launch robotaxis in China during April visit, state media report says**

&#x200B;

*Elon Musk proposed testing Tesla's advanced driver-assistance package in China by deploying it in robotaxis, during his recent visit to the country, the state-backed China Daily newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources.*

*Chinese officials told the Tesla CEO that China ""welcomes Tesla to do some robotaxi tests in the country"" and hopes it can ""set a good example"", the newspaper quoted the sources as saying.*

*However, Chinese authorities did not immediately approve its widespread use of Full Self-Driving (FSD) functions, the newspaper added.*

*Before the full rollout of its FSD functions, Tesla still needs to get approval to collect and transfer data that Tesla's cars need to train its driver-assistance features. The newspaper added that this issue wasn't discussed in detail during Musk's visit.*

*A person briefed on the matter told Reuters that Tesla is seeking to apply to launch the robotaxi tests in Shanghai, where the company's largest factory globally is located.*

*Tesla and the Shanghai city government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.*

*The China Daily report comes shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a whirlwind weekend trip to Beijing late last month, where he met Chinese Premier Li Qiang.*

*Musk on the trip intended to discuss the rollout of FSD and whether Tesla could secure government approvals to transfer data overseas that could prove pivotal in its development of autonomous vehicles, Reuters previously reported.*

*FSD is the most autonomous version of Autopilot software and was rolled out in 2020. Its features include self-parking, auto lane changes and traffic navigation.*

*Among the wins during Musk's trip, which was first reported by Reuters, was a key endorsement from a top Chinese auto association that said Tesla's Model 3 and Y cars were compliant with data-security regulations. That would enable local governments to allow Tesla cars into parts of China they were previously barred from, Chinese media reported, citing a statement from Tesla.*

*Tesla has also reached an agreement with Baidu to use the Chinese tech giant's mapping license for data collection on China's public roads, according to two people who at the time described that as a step toward FSD rollout in China.*

*The China Daily newspaper, however, citing a source close to Baidu, said that the deal only meant that the accuracy of Baidu's maps provided to Tesla would be improved and that it had no direct relation with FSD.*

*Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.*

*Musk has abandoned a longstanding goal for Tesla to make affordable electric cars for the masses and is looking to focus on autonomous driving software, robotaxis and its humanoid robot Optimus.*

*Last month, the company mentioned a ""purpose-built robotaxi product"" that it planned to build with a ""revolutionary"" manufacturing process, without offering a timeline for its release.*

*China has been at the forefront in the development of self-driving cars, and companies such as Baidu and Toyota-backed Pony.ai have launched robotaxi services in limited test zones in several cities.*

**In Tesla Autopilot probe, US prosecutors focus on securities, wire fraud**

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-autopilot-probe-us-prosecutors-focus-securities-wire-fraud-2024-05-08](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-autopilot-probe-us-prosecutors-focus-securities-wire-fraud-2024-05-08)

&#x200B;

*U.S. prosecutors are examining whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric vehicles’ self-driving capabilities, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.*

*Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems assist with steering, braking and lane changes - but are not fully autonomous. While Tesla has warned drivers to stay ready to take over driving, the Justice Department is examining other statements by Tesla and Chief Executive Elon Musk suggesting its cars can drive themselves.*

*U.S. regulators have separately investigated hundreds of crashes, including fatal ones, that have occurred in Teslas with Autopilot engaged, resulting in a mass recall by the automaker.*

*Reuters exclusively reported the U.S. criminal investigation into Tesla in October 2022, and is now the first to report the specific criminal liability federal prosecutors are examining.*

*Investigators are exploring whether Tesla committed wire fraud, which involves deception in interstate communications, by misleading consumers about its driver-assistance systems, the sources said. They are also examining whether Tesla committed securities fraud by deceiving investors, two of the sources said.*

*The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating Tesla’s representations about driver-assistance systems to investors, one of the people said. The SEC declined to comment.*

*Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Last October, it disclosed in a filing that the Justice Department had asked the company for information about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.*

*The Justice Department declined to comment.*

*The probe, which is not evidence of wrongdoing, could result in criminal charges, civil sanctions, or no action. Prosecutors are far from deciding how to proceed, one of the sources said, in part because they are sifting through voluminous documents Tesla provided in response to subpoenas.*

*Reuters could not determine the specific statements prosecutors are reviewing as potentially illegal. Musk has aggressively touted the prowess of Tesla’s driver-assistance technology for nearly a decade.*

*Tesla videos demonstrating the technology that remain archived on its website say: “The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.”*

*A Tesla engineer testified in 2022 in a lawsuit over a fatal crash involving Autopilot that one of the videos, posted in October 2016, intended to show the technology’s potential and did not accurately portray its capabilities at the time. Musk nevertheless posted the video on social media, writing: “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway streets, then finds a parking spot.”*

*In a conference call with reporters in 2016, Musk described Autopilot as “probably better” than a human driver. During an October 2022 call, Musk addressed a forthcoming FSD upgrade he said would allow customers to travel “to your work, your friend’s house, to the grocery store without you touching the wheel.”*

*Musk is increasingly focused on self-driving technology as Tesla's car sales and profit slump. Tesla recently slashed costs through mass layoffs and shelved plans for a long-awaited $25,000 model that had been expected to drive sales growth.*

*“Going balls to the wall for autonomy is a blindingly obvious move,” the billionaire executive posted on his social-media platform X in mid-April. Tesla shares, down more than 28% so far this year, surged in late April when Musk visited China and made progress toward approvals to sell FSD there.*

*Musk has repeatedly promised self-driving Teslas for about a decade. ""Mere failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud,"" Tesla lawyers said in a 2022 court filing.*

*LEGAL CHALLENGES*

*Prosecutors scrutinizing Tesla’s autonomous-car claims are proceeding with caution, recognizing the legal hurdles they face, the people familiar with the inquiry said.*

*They will need to demonstrate that Tesla’s claims crossed a line from legal salesmanship to material and knowingly false statements that unlawfully harmed consumers or investors, three legal experts uninvolved in the probe told Reuters.*

*U.S. courts previously have ruled that “puffery” or “corporate optimism” regarding product claims do not amount to fraud. In 2008, a federal appeals court ruled that statements of corporate optimism alone do not demonstrate that a company official intentionally misled investors.*

*Justice Department officials will likely seek internal Tesla communications as evidence that Musk or others knew they were making false statements, said Daniel Richman, a Columbia Law School professor and former federal prosecutor. That is a challenge, Richman said, but the safety risk involved in overselling self-driving systems also “speaks to the seriousness with which prosecutors, a judge and jury would take the statements.”*

*FATAL CRASHES*

*Tesla’s claims about Autopilot and FSD have also drawn scrutiny in regulatory investigations and lawsuits.*

*Safety regulators and courts have raised concerns in recent months that corporate messaging about the technology - including the brand names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving - have imbued customers with a false sense of security.*

*In April, the Washington State Patrol arrested a man on suspicion of vehicular homicide after his Tesla, with Autopilot engaged, struck and killed a motorcyclist while the driver looked at his phone, police records show. In a probable-cause statement, a trooper cited the driver’s “admitted inattention to driving, while on autopilot mode ... putting trust in the machine to drive for him.”*

*In Washington state, a driver remains ""responsible for the safe and legal operation of that vehicle"" regardless of its technological capabilities, a state patrol spokesperson told Reuters.*

*The same month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into whether a Tesla recall of more than 2 million vehicles in December adequately addressed safety issues with Autopilot.*

*NHTSA declined to comment.*

*The recall followed a long-running probe opened by regulators after cars with Autopilot engaged repeatedly crashed into vehicles at first-responder emergency scenes. Regulators subsequently examined hundreds of crashes where Autopilot was engaged and identified 14 deaths and 54 injuries.*

*Tesla disputed NHTSA's findings but agreed to the recall, which employed over-the-air software updates intended to alert inattentive drivers.*

*The NHTSA investigation found “a critical safety gap between drivers’ expectations” of Tesla’s technology “and the system’s true capabilities,” according to agency records. “This gap led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes.”*",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cn05bd/tsla_robotaxi_in_mainland_china_instead_of_the/
686,1ggehhq,2024-10-31 13:26:37,$UBER is positioned extremely well for the future,"At the time of writing this post, UBER is down 7% in premarket, which is a big overreaction, after their earnings report. I suspect the cause of the drop is the miss on Bookings, which is not significant in my opinion.

Key factors:

- EPS of $1.20, beating expectations of $0.41

- Revenue of $11.2B, beating expectations of $11B

- Total Gross Bookings of $41B, missing expectations of $43B

UBER had a record quarter, for the first time it generated an all time high GAAP operating profits of more than $1B.

In the conference call the CEO and CFO reiterated that they have a very high standard for doing M&A, so the Expedia deal is not set in stone, rather just a rumor.

They've also stated they are looking to reduce share count in 2025, meaning doing share buybacks, which will in turn drive higher share price.

But what I want to talk mostly about is the AV section.

**AV**

The AV (Autonomous vehicle or self driving cars) is a hot topic right now, especially after Teslas event. Despite Tesla being clearly very far behind actual FSD, Waymo is doing AV, and doing it good. They are partenered with UBER and the AV fleet actually had the highest rated score on the platform (as mentioned by their CEO in the earnings call). Beside Waymo, they are partenered with 14 AV companies, including Aurora which they also have a big stake in. AV is coming, maybe not now, maybe not next year, but it is inevitably coming. And all these AV, especially the smaller ones, need a platform to operate their fleet. Do you build it from the ground up or join UBER who has 25 million rides a day already?

They are also partnered with BYD for the electrification of their fleet. Guess what is BYD also working on? Yeah, thats right, AVs. And judging BYD/China success on doing EVs, I think thats a pretty good chance they will also succeed on the AV side. And since they are already partenered, where do you think BYDs AV fleet will be used? In UBER.

I think the company is positioned greatly for the future, its profitable after multiple years of negative EPS, it has a clear plan moving forward about their free cash flow, including reducing $2B out of their debt by the end of the year.

687,1gm1jo6,2024-11-07 21:22:59,Pinterest stock plunges following weak Q4 revenue guidance,"Pinterest shares plunged 15% Thursday after the social media company provided soft guidance for its fourth-quarter revenue despite it beating the top and bottom lines with its third-quarter earnings.

Here’s how the company performed, according to LSEG:

* **Revenue**: $898 million vs. $896 million expected
* **Earnings per share:** 40 cents adjusted vs. 34 cents expected

The company said that fourth-quarter revenue will be between the range of $1.125 million to $1.145 million. The midpoint of the fourth-quarter guidance, $1.135 million, trailed analyst estimates of $1.143 million.

Sales in Pinterest’s third-quarter rose 18% from $763.2 million a year ago.

Pinterest said it had 537 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, topping analyst estimates of 532.6 million.  

The company’s net income grew a whopping 354% year over year to $30.56 million. Its total cost and expenses for the quarter were $904 million, up 17% compared with $768 million the previous year.

Pinterest’s latest quarterly earnings follows the recent U.S. presidential election earlier in the week in addition to multiple earnings reports from other tech companies with online advertising businesses.

Last week, Amazon said its ads business grew 19% year over year to $14.3 billion in the third quarter, and Meta said its third-quarter sales rose 19% year over year to $40.59 billion. However, Meta shares dropped slightly on weaker-than-expected user numbers and warned of a significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses in 2025.

Alphabet said during its third-quarter earnings last week that advertising sales in the period grew 10% year over year to $65.85 billion while its YouTube video unit reported ad revenue of $8.92 billion, up 12% from the previous year.

Microsoft said last week that its search and news advertising revenue jumped 18% year over year as part of its latest earnings report, but the company does not reveal that unit’s specific quarterly sales numbers.

Reddit and Snap also reported their most recent quarterly earnings last week. Reddit said that sales in its third quarter soared 68% to $348.4 million from the prior year while Snap’s third-quarter revenue grew 15% year over year to $1.37 billion.

Monthly active users (MAUs): 3.07 billion vs. 3.06 billion expected, according to StreetAccount


Meta is projected to report revenue growth of 22% as the online advertising market continues to recover from a brutal 2022, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates forced brands to reel in spending.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributes advances in artificial intelligence to improvements in the ad business, which is growing faster than rival Google. In Alphabet’s earnings report on Tuesday, the company said Google ad revenue increased 11% from a year earlier, slower expansion than analysts were expecting.

Part of Meta’s financial recovery over the past year was driven by Chinese retailers, which have bolstered spending to reach users across the globe. Meta finance chief Susan Li most recently highlighted the significance of business from China in the company’s third-quarter earnings report in October. Li didn’t name specific companies, but fast-growing upstarts Temu and Shein, which originated in China, have been pouring money into ads on Facebook and Instagram.

While Meta has a very diverse base of advertisers, some analysts say the potential for Temu and Shein to pull back spending poses a risk because every point of growth matters for a company that saw revenue shrink for three straight quarters in 2022.

Zuckerberg, along with the top executives at TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Snap and Discord, faced tough questioning from lawmakers on Wednesday. They accused the Facebook founder of ignoring the severity of child exploitation on the company’s family of apps.

Parents attending the hearing lambasted Meta and other companies for what they allege are insufficient safety and design measures that have caused mental health issues for their children and, in some cases, even resulted in their deaths.

“I’m sorry for everything you’ve all gone through. It’s terrible,” Zuckerberg told the parents in an emotional scene on Capitol Hill. “No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.” 

Investors will also be looking for signs that Meta’s pivot to the metaverse is bearing fruit. The company has been burning billions of dollars a quarter to build out a virtual world that Zuckerberg has said is the future of computing. In total, the division has lost about $25 billion since the beginning of 2022, shortly after Zuckerberg renamed his company.

Analysts expect Reality Labs to show revenue of $762.8 million for the quarter and an operating loss of $4.26 billion, according to StreetAccount.

Here’s how the company did, compared with the LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected

Revenue: $64.73 billion vs. $64.39 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue increased 15% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $22.04 billion, was up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% during the quarter. Analysts polled by CNBC and StreetAccount had expected 31% growth. Microsoft doesn’t disclose revenue from the category in dollars. Last week Google parent Alphabet said revenue from its cloud business, encompassing Workspace productivity software and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, went up by about 29%. 

During the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft started selling Surface PCs with AI features that can run certain models locally without the need for an internet connection. Dell, HP and other device makers also touted their own so-called Copilot+ PCs. CEO Satya Nadella said at a press briefing in May that “we’re bringing real joy and a sense of wonder back to creation on the PC.”

I am undecided if I should top off any of the ones I just purchased today (thought about increasing RKLB to 1000 shares if things look bright for the future) or consider diversifying further. I have also been looking at AVGO, ASML, MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, AMD, and GOOG. What are some thoughts on these for long term? Or any others that you would recommend?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dkcx7k/best_long_term_stocks_to_invest_in/

The idea is that, by investing in these companies before the market corrects, one stands to experience gains when the price of the stock increases to match the true value.  
  
For March 2024, the most undervalued stocks—those with the lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios for each sector—include energy transportation services company Toro Corp., medical and recreational cannabis seller Aurora Cannabis, cinema advertising firm National CineMedia, and clean energy power producer Alternus Clean Energy Inc.

Now, all my stock picks - TTWO, SPOT, BABA, TSLA, DIS, ETSY - have actively lost me a LOT of money. They're all sitting at 5%-65% losses over multiple years. Meanwhile the two ETFs I'm in have absolutely rocketed over that time-period (QQQ and VOO). It's so frustrating because if I'd have just gone 100% into the ETFs, I would have made so much more money. Obviously that's why ETFs exist and picking stocks is left to professionals..

Still, now, I don't know whether to just sell the above stocks at a loss and go into the ETFs or if that's just me being rash. Each of them are strong companies, for example BABA is underpriced although I know that's because of politics in China, and even the 'overpriced' ones have their arguments of possibly going up more than the ETFs in the future for various reasons (GTA VI is going to be absolutely huge for TTWO, I don't think it's fully priced in yet, and TSLA speculation) but also I don't want to just lose a bunch of money again. At this point is it worth just holding onto them for the possible upswing?

At the end end of the month, I'll get compensation in stock only based on the hours I worked. The contract also says the stock is at 1$ ""preferred"". How does it work ? I never got paid in stock before, and I have noo idea how to liquidate it when I need actual cash in my bank account. I live in Morocco. The company's abroad.

I have never sold or bought stock so any help is appreciated. Some of my questions are:  
What if need cash on hand? Can I just sell easily ?

What if there's no one to sell to ?

What if the company goes bankrupt ?

Should I contact my bank to convert the stock into money ?

Does it take long to convert ?

Is it as reliable as cash in your bank account ?

Also, any taxes I should worry about ?

Thank you all for the helpful comments ! I definitely won't take that job, might try to negotiate actual payment (prolly wont get it, but that's as far as I'll go.)

714,1hftao4,2024-12-16 20:55:23,Fed Will Likely Gift Markets a Rate Cut. How Powell May Still Spoil Christmas and 5 Other Things to Know Today.,"This final full trading week of the year will be far from a sleepy slide into the holiday season.

The Federal Reserve is at a pivotal juncture when it comes to the path of interest rates, while the stock market also faces a critical week amid a period of prolonged broadening weakness.

The central bank is widely expected to cut rates Wednesday—a 97% chance, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. That’s probably a little high, particularly given last week’s sticky inflation data.

In fact, several Fed officials are considering arguing against a cut when officials meet later this week, The Wall Street Journal reported. A hold decision would certainly be a surprise.

A cut is still most likely, but the economic data do not suggest an urgent need to reduce borrowing costs at this point. Consumer prices ticked higher to 2.7% in November, well above the Fed’s 2% inflation target. The economy is still growing at a decent rate of 3.3% in the fourth quarter, according to the GDPNow estimate, and the jobs market is showing resilience.

The counterargument is that the fed-funds rate of 4.5% to 4.75% has room to come down a bit further to align with economic conditions.

Even if a quarter-point cut does come gift-wrapped as expected for the market, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could still be the Grinch who stole Christmas when he speaks after the decision.

A December cut would be the third in succession. That pace cannot continue, so Powell will need to communicate a coming shift in 2025. It could be the last cut for a while, especially given the inflationary impact of Trump’s potential tariffs.

How Powell conveys the message may be critical for the stock market’s reaction.

The S&P 500 is on an unusual run—more stocks have fallen than risen for 10 consecutive days, the longest such streak since Oct. 2000. The index still hit a record high last week but the majority of stocks are struggling.

With a single raise of an eyebrow or a turn of phrase, Powell could signal a Santa rally or even a Santa slump.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hftao4/fed_will_likely_gift_markets_a_rate_cut_how/
715,1an2ty8,2024-02-10 00:10:20,"META Still The Cheapest of The Magnificent 7, Am I Wrong?","Quick glance at some of the numbers for META. That EPS is crazy good, going back to the good times of 2021 all over again.

GOOG, MSFT, AAPL are trading at good prices, but META is a more attractive investment option, imo. AVGO is also another good option although not part of the Mag 7, yes or no?

AMZN, NVDA, and TSLA are excluded due to their high prices. Despite the sky high price, NVDA is a better pick compared to AMZN or TSLA, imo.

Clean energy stocks have been dropping significantly in these few days, but I am optismistic it will go up in the forseeable future, here's why:

1: Solar and Offshore Wind are fundamentally more cost effective than natural gas alternatives, meaning these are profitable business model that businesses will develop regardless of government subsidies.

2: The IRA will unlikely to be fully repealed due to the massive amounts of employment it provides to red states.

3: While tariff will make clean energy projects more expensive on net, it also gradually reduces US clean energy firms' reliance on China which means a stronger future for the companies.

4: With regard to oil stocks, I believe the price of oil will drop significantly since drill baby drill which means Trump will expand oil drilling in the continental shells, so lower priced oil will reduce profit margins for oil companies, making oil stocks perform worst.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

729,1gfm8o3,2024-10-30 13:15:05,Volkswagen profit plunges 42% in third quarter amid sweeping overhaul plans,"German automaker Volkswagen on Wednesday reported a 42% drop in operating profit in the third quarter.

Operating profit fell to 2.86 billion euros ($3.1 billion), while third quarter sales revenues slipped 0.5% year on year to around 78.5 billion euros.

Vehicle sales fell 8.3% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same time period a year earlier, Volkswagen said.

Net liquidity across the Volkswagen Group stood at negative 160.6 billion euros at the end of September 2024, it said. The company’s net liquidity stood at negative 147.4 billion euros at the end of 2023.

Volkswagen on Wednesday said that its results across the first three quarters of the year were impacted by higher fixed costs and restructuring efforts. Operating profit between January and September of this year was 21% lower on an annual basis.

Volkswagen shares were were last 1.8% higher at 8:19 a.m. London time.

Arno Antlitz, chief financial officer and chief operating officer at Volkswagen Group, said the performance reflected a “challenging market environment” and highlighted the importance of ongoing performance programs across the company.

The third quarter results come after Volkswagen last month cut its 2024 annual outlook for the second time in just a few months. At the time, the car maker said it was expecting a profit margin of around 5.6% for the year, along with a 0.7% drop in sales to 320 billion euros. Those figures were left unchanged on Wednesday.

Volkswagen has been in hot water in recent months, warning of potential plant closures in Germany and scrapping a slew of labor agreements with local workers in September. The company also said it would end its employment protection agreement, which has been in place for its German workforce since 1994.

On Monday, the Volkswagen works council said the company’s management was planning widespread pay cuts and layoffs, as well as the closure or size reduction of all of its German plants.

In response, Volkswagen reiterated the need for restructuring and said that it would present plans for work cost cuts during a round of negotiations about the labor agreements, which is also taking place on Wednesday.

“Ahead of the negotiations today, we need to state: the situation is getting more serious,” Volkswagen’s chief negotiator Arne Meiswinkel said on Wednesday according to a CNBC translation.

He added that current developments in the auto industry in Europe and especially in Germany were concerning, as shown by the latest figures from both the company and its competitors.

Meiswinkel reiterated that Volkswagen needed to lower costs and increase its efficiency to be in a position that allows it to invest in its future.

One of the first trades I did was buying TSLA at about 170. It ended up dropping to 165 or so and I sold to prevent losses. It dropped to the 140s but obviously now it is in the 180s. I accepted a loss when holding for not even that much longer would have made decent profit.

After I learned a lesson about patience there, I’ve been trying to hold, but a few choices I’ve made don’t show signs of rebounding (SEDG is down 20% today and has been decreasing pretty steadily since I bought in).

I’m still undecided if I’d like to cut my losses and try to invest in something that will give more returns in the meantime, or if I hope that the solar sector has a strong rebound in the (very) long term and just continue to hold.

Mercedes-Benz Group AG adjusts full-year guidance for the year 2024 based on current market outlook

Stuttgart, Germany - As a result of recent developments, Mercedes-Benz Group AG today adjusted its earnings outlook for the year 2024 for Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Group.

This was triggered by a further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment, mainly in China. GDP growth in China lost further momentum amid weaker consumption as well as the continued downturn in the real estate sector. This affected the overall sales volume in China including sales in the Top-End segment. Overall, the sales mix in the second half of 2024 is expected to remain unchanged versus the first half, and therefore weaker than originally expected.

Additionally, the second half of 2024 is expected to be impacted by various valuation adjustments. Furthermore, the dynamic pricing environment is expected to continue.

Therefore, Mercedes-Benz Group has updated its full-year outlook:

Mercedes-Benz Cars now expects the adjusted Return on Sales to be between 7.5% and 8.5% (previously: 10% to 11%). This implies an expected adjusted Return on Sales of around 6% for the second half of the year. The valuation adjustments are expected to have an impact of around 1 percentage point in the second half of this year.
Mercedes-Benz Vans’ expected adjusted Return on Sales (14% to 15%) and Mercedes-Benz Mobility’s expected adjusted Return on Equity (8.5% to 9.5%) remain unchanged.
Mercedes-Benz Group’s EBIT is now expected to be significantly below the prior year level (previously: slightly below the prior-year level).
Free cash flow of the industrial business for the Mercedes-Benz Group is now expected to be significantly below the prior-year level (previously: slightly below the prior-year level).

734,1dx6ml8,2024-07-07 03:00:04,What determines a stock price? Is it the intrinsic value of a company or the public perception of such," Im having trouble understanding what determines the value of a stock. If it is determined by the finances of a company in a literal way. My understanding was that its public perception of the company that effects the share price after the initial public offering. Like they release all the total shares of the company at the public offering, and then after it is simply the public trading in the market and determining the share price value. 
The reason this question has come up is in regards to a dividend payment. Is it my share of the profits (free money) or are they taking away from their share price to pay for the dividend? I didnt know companies had the power to do that other than through a stock split. So Im deeply confused.

739,1ht9qr5,2025-01-04 08:04:26,Is it worth it to invest time into learning technical analysis? ,"For context, I've been buying stocks and options since I turned 18 around 3 months ago, so I don't have a lot of experience or knowledge in the first place. I've just been making moves based on my own research combined with other people's ideas. I was looking through a discord where people share their ideas as I wanted to expand my portfolio past being 65% NVDA and 35% random bullshit, and I often see these pictures of daily 5 minute candles with countless horizontal, diagonal, and curvy lines. The poster then mentions various names for some candlestick patterns and says something about how the stock closed above/under the EMA or some crap then proceeds to justify their following move, seeming to have full confidence because of this chart they drew.

So I thought, if I could go by the book and use rules and numbers to get a solid guess on which way the stock's gonna go, I'd be rich. But if it were that easy, everyone would be rich. And one look through this r/wallstreetbets makes it clear that there's not a lot of people who have achieved that status.

I'm posting to ask if learning about all this is worth it. I know that the market is unpredictable and there's no way looking at a bunch of lines will give me a positive winrate, but does it help? For example, could you have a better chance at guessing what's gonna happen in the next 30 minutes if you recognized the pattern that came before it? I know that I cannot expect the book to be right all the time, but would it at least give me a better shot at it?

I haven't tried this at all and so far I've been doing fine, though I know the stuff I've bought have been nice to me in the months I've held it and I can't expect the same in the future (I started with 7k, now at 9k, with 50% of gains unrealized from mostly NVDA and RKLB, 50% of gains realized from TSLA and NVDA calls bought post-election). I know reading these patterns won't help in the long run, as I'm holding shares and am not planning to sell in the foreseeable future, but I want to understand what these people are talking about when they do TAs and try it for myself to see if it actually helps or not. Maybe try buying 0dte for SPY and QQQ to harvest some loss porn for WSB.

Its the nature of the beast sometimes for a stock to uncontrollably run up. It's rare a stock stays up that high. Only exception to the rule is something like tsla stock.

in the last decades, with infinite money printing glitch,

there has been enormous level of PE multiple expansion across vast majority of slow growth companies

if you look at no growth/slow growth companies, their pe ratio has expanded (after 2008 and infinite QE) from 10-15 to 20, 30, 30 or even up to 80

question is, can such enormous pe ratio be justifiable even with no unlimited QE/free money when their growth are  literally non existent when interest rate is no longer 0% but at 2\~5%?

Contrary to most people's belief, imo, lots of tech stock, high growth companies are actually the cheapest (yes. cheapest) stock right now  if you consider company's earning and growth in to the equation

what do you think?

Before I go further, this is just a discussion post, not necessarily a “technical analysis”.

Full disclosure, I’ve just recently yeeted into a decent chunk of my portfolio into Rivian averaging $15.50/share.

Yes, they keep asking for offerings for multiple billions of dollars in new funding, but it’s for the right reasons, and theoretically the correct results of in just a few years increasing their production capacity from 25k to over 500k. It takes massive capital to due this feat. Something I don’t think any other EV brand outside of TSLA is able to do, while also having the most superior product in the industry. 

The even better news being the demand has only skyrocketed, and (hope I don’t jinx it with upcoming quarterly report) there doesn’t seem to be signs of slowing demand. Which is huge because right now their cheapest car is $80k, and they’re soon announcing their $40k line that should supplement their existing $80k lines and commercial delivery truck lines to hit their max 500k capacity.

To me, my yolo bolo brain. It does not seem like a bizzare bet that in 2026 they sell at their 500k capacity as their popularity within the United States is still climbing, and launching an affordable line is only going to increase interest.

Do you have one or two stocks you constantly buy and sell? They have a somewhat predictable range, and you can consistently depend on them to stay within that range. So you know if you buy at a certain price, it'll go up in a certain range, sell it, and then wait for it to drop again, rinse and repeat.

I'm just wondering if most people are constantly going for new stocks all the time or if you kind of stay within a small group and just wait for prices you like on them and are just constantly buying and selling the same stocks.

[TSLA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) - We saw TSLA delay their Robotaxi Event from August to October, watching for some form of bounce in the stock. Currently long, but will remain agile (as usual) if we selloff at the open.



[NVDA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d) - We also saw this turn more strongly than the other Mag7 stocks because of the close to 15% move we saw it make in the past week. No opinion on this yet, but watching for a setup.

[SNOW](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d) - AT&T ($T) had their customer data illegaly downloaded from a workspace on a third-party cloud platform (identified as SNOW’s). Might be user error/social engineering (not sure) rather than a cybersecurity issue, so we might see a reversal of this move at the open. However, it should noted that there were no multifactor authentication safeguards in place in previous hacks of SNOW.



[JPM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JPM&p=d) - Reports $4.40 vs $4.19 expected EPS. NI at $18B was up 25% from the same period a year ago due to exchange of shares in Visa that provided $8B in gains.

763,1hbf2zb,2024-12-10 23:07:41,Siemens - worth a look? A balanced view.,"Purpose of this post is to get a sense of 'sentiment' about Siemens. It's not a lazy $hit post, asking ""what do y'all think yo""? But yeah, essentially, that's what I am asking, besides listing down a long list of pros and cons of the company.

I've no position yet (long or short), but thinking of it.

Pros:

1. The conglomerate needs no introduction. There's virtually NO piece of any complex, industrial machinery (boats, planes, turbines, large diesel engines, data center infrastructure, heating, cooling, all kinds of factories, power plant, high voltage transformer...) that doesn't have at least a few critical components made by Siemens. The company stands to benefit from **energy transition, mobility, urbanization** (smart cities), and is focused on **high-margin** specialized components.
2. Valuations: 18 PE, 1.9 PS [Siemens AG - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SIE:ETR?window=YTD)
3. News: there's plenty of positive news and developments [Google News ](https://news.google.com/search?for=siemens&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en) Most notably, partnership with NVDA for industrial robotics applications. Won a few contracts in the middle East. 
4. Gaining momentum: for last 10 days at least, the trading volume is virtually all **BUY volume**. BUY volume means the trades were executed at 'ask' price. Buyers had to up their bids to get hands on the stock.
5. Low retail concentration: only 19% retail shareholders. Less susceptible to 'crowd' thinking. It's not your GME or TSLA which will up/down 10% in a day. Movements will be very slow and steady. In other words, low volatality. It's a steady wealth builder with 14% YTD; don't expect 500% in 5 years.

Cons:

1. German company. Yes, yes, we know Germany is in recession, aging population, generally hard business climate.. etc etc. But the company's operations are global. The only geographical 'risk' is, you've a stock in EUR currency, not traded as ADR on US exchange (as far as I know). Revenues come from all over the world, in many currencies.
2. Lot of competition: ABB, GE, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Larsen & Toubro.. may not be retail, well known names, but they all do the same stuff, some better; some worse.

Since everyone is calling for current US market overvaluation, I wanted to check out if US stocks are really as overvalued as people are saying by different countries and each sector individually.  
So I did manually, based on trailing PE weighted by market cap.

You can take your own conclusions, to me the situation doesn't look so bad.  
The only apparent overvaluation looks in the electronic technology sector, but we all know the reason (AI/GPU wave).

Data was pulled from TradingView and few mistakes/outliers were adjusted manually.

Interesting enough, consumer durables overvaluation is due to TSLA alone.

The Detroit automaker said the decline to 594,233 vehicles sold during the first three months of the year was largely due to a 22.9% year-over-year decline in sales to fleet customers. Retail sales to customers were up 6%, GM said.

Sales of GM’s all-electric vehicles, closely watched by Wall Street, remained miniscule during the first quarter. EV sales were 16,425 units, or 2.8% of the automaker’s overall sales during the period.

GM’s sales are below expectations for the overall industry, which Cox Automotive forecast to be up 5.5% from a year earlier.

Buick was the only GM brand to report a sales increase during the quarter, up 16.4% from a year earlier. The GMC truck brand was off about 5%, while Cadillac and Chevrolet were both off about 2%.

This news was met with positivity in the stock market, with Arcadium's shares climbing over 2% in after-hours trading.

However, the path to the deal is not without its obstacles. Arcadium is currently dealing with legal challenges from a section of its shareholders.

These shareholders have lodged lawsuits against the company, accusing it of misrepresentation, concealment, and negligence in relation to the takeover deal. This information was disclosed by Arcadium in a regulatory filing earlier this month.

Earlier in the year, Rio Tinto stated its intention to acquire Arcadium at a price of $5.85 per share, which was paid in cash. This purchase price represented a nearly 90% premium on Arcadium's closing stock price on October 4, the day a potential deal was first reported by Reuters.

The acquisition will grant Rio Tinto access to Arcadium's lithium mines, processing facilities, and deposits located in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

Additionally, Rio Tinto will also inherit Arcadium's customer base, which includes major automotive manufacturers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), BMW (ETR:BMWG), and General Motors (NYSE:GM).",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hte6xi/arcadium_lithium_says_shareholders_approved_rio/

772,1ehnm3r,2024-08-01 18:13:46,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

774,1g6ahuv,2024-10-18 05:03:01,"Large cap tech, Nvidia, and by extension US index funds are likely to crash, small cap value/international to outperform. Here's why","If you look at the story of how the S&P500 has performed so well over the past decade, the answer is high return on invested capital from tech companies. By hiring top engineers to build innovative products, and scaling the product globally, these companies to achieved rapid growth at little cost, resulting in impressive returns to shareholders. Historically, hardware costs were very cheap to scale compared to the revenue it brings in. You could spend a few thousand per month in hosting costs, and bring in millions in profits.

However, this is changing. 7 out of 10 of the top holdings in the S&P500 are gambling huge on AI- they have laid off tens of thousands of the talented engineers that drove their earnings growth, in order to fund expensive acquisitions of AI hardware(Not counting Nvidia because they are the ones profiting from it).

Tech can no longer be seen as an industry with low capital costs, because AI is tremendously expensive to deploy and maintain. For example, Microsoft expects to spend $100 Billion on AI datacenters through Fiscal 2027. That's 40% more than their entire profit in 2023. Because AI hardware is so expensive, and the electricity usage is so tremendous, these future applications are no longer cheap to deploy and maintain.

ChatGPT is perhaps the best example of this. Despite being tremendously successful from a growth perspective, it has been tremendously unprofitable from an operating standpoint, and relies on continued bailouts from large companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Softbank to stay afloat. 

The economics of tech companies is quickly changing; with companies in an arms race to acquire as many Nvidia chips as possible to build the best GenAI applications, they are hurting their margins and operating profitability.

The impact of these investments has been quite lousy so far; other than some round tripping transactions to create fake revenue and balance sheet growth, these ai investments, while tremendously expensive, have not paid off:

- Microsoft's CoPilot has been a complete failure, consumers are not buying CoPilot pcs, and the CoPilot app has a 2.3 star rating on the Windows store. They are also facing regulatory pressure in Europe over Recall.

- Google's AI is providing dangerous and potentially deadly misinformation to users of its search engine, such as incorrect advice about prescriptions.

- Amazon's ""Go"" stores were supposed to use ML/AI to handle checkouts, when in reality, the AI failed to handle most of the work, and the remainder was just outsourced to human operators in India which struggled to keep up with the workload.

- Tesla has still failed to implement full self driving, and during its robotaxi event, had human actors control the robots to fake them being AI controlled.

- Google's Waymo is very impressive from a technology standpoint, but its hardware costs and regulatory barriers make it unlikely to achieve profitability, even as it expands.

Despite the poor results of AI investments so far, all of the top 10 holdings in the S&P500 other than Berkshire Hathaway trade at very high P/E Ratio, suggesting that very high earnings growth is priced in.

Even if AI will have a significant impact on the economy and society, the economics of it are not favorable to investors due to the high capex costs involved. Tech is no longer an industry where a team of 10-20 engineers can build a product that brings in Billions in revenue, with minimal hosting costs. It is now an industry where Billions of capital expenditures are needed just to build a model, and margins on the finished product are very poor.

Of course, tech CEOs realize this; which is why Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google are all working to replace Nvidia hardware, which sells at a huge markup, with their own in house chips. This is a tremendous threat to Nvidia's long term prospects.

Given the high expectations implied by elevated price to earnings ratios, and the poor financial performance of AI applications, it does seem quite unlikely that large caps will continue to outperform.

Small cap value and international stocks are almost certainly a better investment; if AI does drive significant productivity improvements, then labor heavy businesses will benefit from improved margins from using these products that large tech companies are offering.

Looking at small cap value funds like AVUV, and international stock indexes, there are a tremendous amount of labor intensive businesses with low margins in these funds that would benefit from AI/ML. Net margins going from 3% to 10% due to improved productivity would mean earnings more than tripling.

This has historically been the case with technical revolutions. For example, railroads revolutionized our economy and drove tremendous economic growth, but they provided terrible returns to shareholders.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6ahuv/large_cap_tech_nvidia_and_by_extension_us_index/

776,1dye0im,2024-07-08 17:00:51,How to surpass the fear of selling?,"Long story short: I have some unrealised gains on stocks that I bought time ago (AMAT and ASML).

I was multiple times on the verge of selling (totally or partially) to realise gains that I could invest in another opportunity with better potential. However, every time one of these opportunities came up, I ended up always retracting and not doing so, because I didn’t want to “give-up” to the long-term perspective I committed when I started in this.

Sadly, with opportunities I mean Meta falling like crazy 1.5 years ago for the overreaction to the decrease in user registrations, Nvidia at 200 (before split), or Netflix also dropping to 180 in mid-2022. Recently, I was about to do the same to buy a chunk of TSLA. But fear always gets me.

I know, everything is about risk tolerance. Maybe I am not made for this, who knows. However, I would be happy to know your opinion about this. I really want to take the chance if I believe that is the right choice. Any state of mind that helps you clicking in the sell button? I’m just tired of missing opportunities just for being afraid.

Here is some knowledge for all of the regards who have no idea who PSNY is good luck boy

So PSNY better known as POLESTAR is the EV baby of VOLVO. They got spun off and was basically released from them in early 2024 since Volvo said they were positioned for growth. Okay enough with the fucking history lesson…

The stock has been floating at around $1 USD after being around the $0.70 mark at the end of last month. So they are seeing some positive movement already in the last couple of weeks. This is just due to it being undervalued overall and a correction from what I can tell. 

As of last week they finally broke above there SMA50 and are showing some signs of a recovery. This is good news for a longer look as they should be able to hold at this $1 mark and not need to deal with delisting.

They are expanding into new market and their finances are finally in order. Previously they had some problems with delivering EPS etc but they are now closing the gap on their burn rate and looking towards positivity. 

The company while not selling a large volume of cars is under valued for the number of cars they sell at the current price point. TSLAs price per car is great than a 5X value while PSNY is less than 1/2X that. Okay I know TSLA is awesome so that’s why the price per expect sales is so high… well LCID is at 2 1/2X and they haven’t been doing so hot so once again this company is undervalued for what they are performing.

Fact is, if you have a 401k that invests in an S&P index fund, or if you DCA into VOO or whatever other S&P fund you're into, then Mag 7 is already your primary holding. And I would guess one or both of those scenarios cover 95% of the people who post here.

Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Some of the stocks I post are <$500M market cap and are NOT good long-term investments, but are good candidates to day trade.  
  
**News: Biggest news today is the stock package that China is considering worth $278B.**   
  
**ADM,** liquidity 8/10- Yesterday, had news to place their CFO on admin leave, today news was released that the investigation is “hopefully” concluded by end of February. This may be fraud, be careful.   
  
**JBLU/SAVE,** liquidity 9/10- SAVE still coming in with massive volume and upward movement, likely due to JBLU saying they will appeal the decision. I personally am not a long-term holder in this, if JBLU really succeeds in appealing this is a process that will likely takes months. Still worth looking for a trade in this.   
  
**TKO,** liquidity 7/10- Made deal with Netflix for content, and Dwayne Johnson appointed to board. Up 20% from this news.   
  
**BILI- l**iquidity, 7/10- Chinese gaming regulators to remove rules for controlling spending in video games  
  
**BABA**\- liquidity, 8/10- Rumor that Jack Ma has been buying BABA shares  
  
**NVDA,** liquidity 8/10- Sold off slightly today, we couldn’t hold the 600 level. Could see this reclaim the $600 level, large 13 point move off the open.   
  
**Stocks worth watching on a longer timeframe**   
  
**TSLA,** liquidity 7/10- Worth watching with Elon Musk fighting for 25% ownership of the company.  
  
**JNPR,** liquidity 9/10 – HPE confirmed to buy JNPR at $40/cash, just leaving this on here for people to be aware, or if you want to play the merger arb.  
  
**NS-** to be acquired by Sunoco for $7B in stock.  
  
**M-** rejects $5.8B cash bid, saying it is not good enough (21/sh). Could see this go higher from a rival bidder

[**TSLA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) - Adjusted EPS is $.52, missed estimates for fourth consecutive quarter. Also confirmed by Musk that he’s pushing back Robotaxi event to October. Despite the earnings miss, revenue beat expectations ($25.5B). Also announced manufacture of new, lower-cost cars in first half of next year. Musk also announced he’s going to pare down his commitment to give $45M a month to the ex-President T.

[**CRWD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWD&p=d) - Fourth day of trading since the outage- we saw a GREAT trade yesterday at the open when CRWD sold off from 269->260 and bounced back- going to be watching to see if anything similar like that happens today. Currently long.

[**GOOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d) - Beat estimates as cloud business grows, but AI losses grow. EPS of 1.89 vs 1.85e and revenue of $84.7B vs $84.3B. Some Jefferies analyst spoke that meaningful AI revenue is more likely to be a 2025-2026 event.

[**V**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=V&p=d) - Transaction volume up, $ volume down. Reported a $8.9B vs $8.91B expected. EPS of $2.51 vs $2.43. Note that the quarterly revenue missing is EXTREMELY rare for V, thus the selloff for the stock despite beating estimates. Overall signals weakness for the credit card giants because AXP missed earnings last week as well.

I was doing some reflecting, looking at my portfolio that I have slowly been building since July / Aug of 2021. I have mostly been doing stock picking based on companies I liked, and unfortunately I have come to the realization that I have missed out on quite a bit of gains from not simply investing in VOO or SPY. My total return on three years of investing is 25% (although last week it peaked at 39%, which probably goes to show that I am over exposed), but had I just put my money in VOO in a dollar cost averaging method, I would likely have a much higher return.

Any advice for me? Should I just sell things off and put them in VOO? My current portfolio breakdown looks like this. Of course some bigger losers I have sold off. *$7934 invested, $9950 current.*

794,1dppvgp,2024-06-27 12:16:42,Mastering Long-Term Investments: Combining Technical and Fundamental Analysis,"By Technical or fundamental analysis: which one is better for long-term investing? Myriad investors use one or the other technique on its own seemingly successfully, but using only one presents significant limitations.      

Using a combination of both could be the ultimate winning strategy. Although the topic of technical analysis is controversial among a certain group of Wall Street investors, recent data points toward its importance when investing for the future. 

A study from March 2023 by Fidelity Investments’ Vice President of Advanced Analytics and Insights Jasleen Kaur and a professor at the School of Business Studies in India Khushdeep Dharni looked at two different strategies of investing using advanced mathematics and computer software to mine the data necessary for more profitable trading. 

Computer algorithms examined both technical indicators and fundamental data across over 381 companies, showing that data-mining techniques incorporating elements of both technical and fundamental analysis led to better investment returns than a pure buy-and-hold strategy. 

Sifting through a huge pile of data seems much easier with the rise of faster technology, but the core principles behind the platforms with automated tools have been around for a long time and could still be used by a qualified person to reach the same results.

https://preview.redd.it/m7i4i1d7w39d1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cec9baea1fc05d2a3d391395bc0981ac8dd7987a

Conducting fundamental analysis is crucial when evaluating stocks. One should have a comprehensive understanding of a company’s financial health and performance. The kind of stock to keep for the next 10 or 20 years is the second important component — will the company or commodity exist in the future, or is it a dying business that’ll be outlawed eventually? Fundamental analysis is used in finance to evaluate the intrinsic value or real worth of a security as well as entire sectors and markets.

There’s widespread agreement that assessing investments through fundamental analysis is necessary for long term investing. Although important, on its own it could prove to be limiting. For example, if one evaluates the stock and does not look at the current chart and volume movement, one could buy an overpriced stock right before the price is set to crash.

The second step, which is also of significance, involves conducting technical analysis. Unlike fundamental analysis, which focuses on the intrinsic value of an asset, the technical analysis examines the volume and price of shares over time. If used in isolation, one could buy a stock of a company that is about to go under and lose all the investment. Meanwhile, the data shows that technical analysis is just as important.

While the United States and India have very different markets, markets around the world are similar in terms of behavioral psychology and the research findings are true for investors around the globe in many ways.

Overall, it’s as hard to predict where the market will turn next as it is to predict the future. Whether one is seeking to improve their lifestyle or prepare for retirement, the data is important to consider. Investing is risky. The more confluence one could find pointing toward a similar direction, the better.

It’s important to use both techniques in investing and not to be susceptible to impulse investing or simply trusting someone’s piece of advice. Diligent research is paramount — looking for and evaluating the newest research is crucial.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dppvgp/mastering_longterm_investments_combining/

# [Stock futures are flat after two straight down days for S&P 500, Nasdaq: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were flat Thursday as Wall Street looks to regain momentum after a rocky start to September. Key labor market data is also on deck this week.
*****
> Futures for the S&P 500 were up marginally, while Nasdaq 100 futures hovered near the flatline. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 50 points.
*****
> The moves come after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each closed lower for the second straight session, dipping 0.16% and 0.30%, respectively. The Dow squeezed out a gain of 38 points, or 0.09%, on Wednesday.
*****
> All three averages are down for the week, with key employment reports looming. On Thursday morning, investors will get to sift through weekly jobless claims data, while the August nonfarm payrolls report is due out Friday.
*****
> The market has appeared to be sensitive to potential growth scares in recent weeks, including Tuesday’s sell-off on the heels of weak manufacturing data. That could put increased importance on the jobless claims data, BMO Wealth Management chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma said on “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “That’s more of a forward-looking indicator. As long as those stay low — people have jobs, people remain confident in the ability to find jobs or comfortable in the jobs that they have — we think that they will continue to spend. So as long as those numbers stay low, if we get some blips in the overall monthly jobs report that shows weakness on the edges, we’re not quite as concerned,” Ma said.
*****
> The employment data could play a key role in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision later this month. Ma said he still believes the U.S. economy is on track for a “soft landing” and that the market rally should eventually broaden out. However, he added that there is likely to be continued market turbulence in the near term.
*****
> “We believe in it, we just think it’s going to be on pause for a few months because this high degree of uncertainty we have right now. There’s just too much that needs to resolved over the coming months. … It’s just very hard for the broadening-of-the-market theme to really gather momentum,” Ma said.

806,1arfamq,2024-02-15 13:21:51,EV school bus company BLBD.  $9 to $31 (and rising).,"I started investing in EV school bus company BLBD at $9/share.  Right before Biden was elected.  I knew that if he won, a national conversion from internal combustion buses to electric would begin.  Today, the stock is at $31.  The EV school bus conversion is just beginning, and BLBD is well positioned for it.

Most school buses fleets are perfect for EV conversion.  Routes and charging schedules are very predictable, and the lower EV bus maintenance costs offset the higher initial investment needed.  And of course, with the Biden administration has come incentives.  Another interesting thing to know is that a charged fleet of buses can be used to power a community in emergencies (this is called V2G, or Vehicle to Grid).

So far my investment has been very successful.  $9 to $31, etc.  BLBD just recieved a record order for 180 EV buses.  They recently delivered their 1,500th EV bus.  They now have an Electric Vehicle Build-up Center with an annual capacity of up to 5,000 electric school buses.

This company is like a mini version of TSLA.  One of the few un-tapped opportunities remaining in the EV space.  Sharing all this because I think it’s exciting.

**HOOD-** Beats earnings with 0.18 vs 0.05 expected, revenue of 618M vs 534M expected. Keeps FY 24 guidance. Note that they are still under SEC investigation for crypto listings.   
   
**GME-** We saw massive momentum Friday at the close, then again Monday in the morning. It hasn’t retraced the move for the last 4 days, so still worth keeping an eye on. $17 level worth watching.

Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.

  
This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.

  
I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. 

Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question”.

**TSLA-** Missed earnings but the stock went up anyway. Tesla's first-quarter earnings showed drops of 9% for sales and 48% for adjusted profit, as compared with first-quarter 2023 results. Revenue dropped to $21.3 billion.  
  
  
**RILY-** Confirms that the company had nothing to do with Brian Kahn, who the company had a close relationship with. Kahn was involved in the collapse of a hedge fund and defaulted on settlements to pay off defrauded investors.   
   
**CPRI-** Yesterday’s news- FTC sues to block Tapestry’s $8.5 acquisition of CPRI, vote was rumored to be 5-0 (meaning that it’s extremely unlikely this acquisition will go through). Stock has fallen even further today, worth watching.  
   
**BA-** Reported earnings today- -$1.13 vs -$1.43 EPS, confirmed cuts of 737 production. Sold half of my position at open, still holding the rest from $170.

824,1cb57ss,2024-04-23 13:53:10,These are the stocks on my watchlist (4/23),"  

Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.

This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.

I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question”. 

News: [Tesla Stock in ‘No Man’s Land’ After 43% Rout Ahead of Earnings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-23/tesla-stock-in-no-man-s-land-after-43-rout-ahead-of-earnings)

**TSLA-**Again, worth watching today. Hit lows on the 90 day chart, forecasts look bad, and earnings will be the crux today. At this point, I have no idea how earnings will go. 

**IBRX- FDA Approves bladder cancer therapy**

SPOT- Becomes profitable, revenue and earnings guidance beat expectations, though actual reported numbers are below expectations. $315 level worth watching. 

CPRI- FTC sues to block Tapestry’s $8.5 acquisition of CPRI, vote was rumored to be 5-0 (meaning that it’s extremely unlikely this acquisition will go through).

**JBLU/SAVE,** liquidity 9/10- SAVE fell another 10% today- this probably isn’t going to go to 0, but I plan to trade any order flow that comes in with moderate/small size.   
  
**NVDA,** liquidity 8/10- Broke all times highs AGAIN- 575, 550, and 600 levels worth watching. This thing is a steam train and $600 is the major level that will make or break this stock (if we ever reach it). Not worth playing otherwise IMO.

**Standing tickers**  
  
**TSLA,** liquidity 7/10- Worth watching with Elon Musk fighting for 25% ownership of the company.   
  
**RIOT/MARA/COIN/BITO/IBIT/HOOD/GBTC** \- Worth watching proxies off the open for order flow moves (will remove this when moves no longer get larger).

TSLA, liquidity 7/10- Earnings were a slight miss on expectations, signaled 2024 growth may be lower than 2023. We’re seeing a continuation of that move from 2 days ago after-market. Looking to see if there’s a bounce/reversal in there somewhere. (150 is the sweet spot but I doubt it’ll get there)

# [Stock futures tick higher after major averages claw back some of this week's losses: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures inched higher Thursday after the major averages posted their first winning session in three days.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 37 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures ticked up by 0.2%, and Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.4%.
*****
> Victoria’s Secret plunged 29% after posting mixed quarterly results and issuing disappointing guidance. On the other hand, U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk popped more than 5% on the back of positive trial results for an obesity treatment.
*****
> Those moves come after the three major averages finished higher Wednesday, a turn from back-to-back losing sessions seen earlier in the week. Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors finished higher, led to the upside by utilities.
*****
> At one point, New York Community Bancorp tumbled more than 40% during Wednesday’s session, but it finished with a 7.5% gain after announcing a $1 billion capital raise.
*****
> Apple fell for a sixth consecutive day, bringing its weekly losses to nearly 6%. Elsewhere in tech, Nvidia has continued rising in premarket trading, and the artificial intelligence darling’s week-to-date gain sits near 8% as of Thursday morning.
*****
> During Wednesday’s testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, the central bank chair indicated that the policy rate is at its “peak for this tightening cycle,” but reinforced that the Fed is not ready to begin reducing rates. Investors will also monitor Powell’s appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.
*****
> “The market digested the reality that Powell was on board with respect to cutting rates this year. The question now becomes when, how often and how many cuts,” said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments.
*****
> Beyond Powell, Wall Street is also on the lookout for the latest jobless claims data, and trade balance and consumer credit data for January. This comes ahead of February’s closely watched jobs report slated for Friday morning.

Tesla’s still the clear leader here, and honestly, I don’t see that changing anytime soon. Musk’s influence and the brand’s momentum feel unstoppable, even with all the competition. But the rest of the U.S. market? It feels like it’s dragging its feet. GM and Ford have some EVs out, but they’re nowhere near as exciting as what’s coming out of China. Companies like BYD, NIO, and even Lotus are innovating faster, scaling bigger, and even exporting to places like Europe and Japan. Meanwhile, the U.S. is still struggling to build enough charging stations.

I get that the government is pushing EV adoption, but let’s be real—this is still a country obsessed with gas-powered trucks and SUVs. Are we really going to see a meaningful shift to EVs in the next few years, or is it just hype? I’m bullish on EVs long-term, but right now, it feels like the U.S. is falling behind while China and Europe race ahead.

836,198a8pc,2024-01-16 18:38:33,Tesla stock grab ultimatum,"I just saw this on CNN and may be the first time I ever heard of something like this. Elon Musk is (practically) demanding he have his voting power **doubled** in the company. This after he sold huge chunks, such as to finance buying Twitter. 

>  In a series of posts on X Monday night, Musk said that he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company’s stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns.

> “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” Musk wrote in a post on X. “Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.”

So the 2nd block he’s essentially threatening to spin off and make competition. 

But how does a public company address this? If they awarded him some GIGANTIC options, it would massively dilute existing shares. If they made another voting class of shares, x20,000 voting rights, they could just give a small pile of those, but what Board could transfer 12% voting interest in a public company based on some tweets? How would that be upholding their corporate responsibilities?

Is this some insider key to the sell off they’ve been experiencing? Cuz it’s frankly scary to me. And it’s scary because I think he might get it. Which does a lot to undercut the trust I have in the Board. I had been thinking of doing an option on them if they dropped to maybe 200-205. But this is just an ugly ultimatum that seems capable of vastly changing the value of the company. 

OR am I blowing things out of proportion? I admit I don’t follow the company religiously and for all I know musk makes a post like this every month.

837,1hv5dc3,2025-01-06 18:04:38,Tesla's Deliveries Disappoint: Time To Take Profits (Rating Downgrade),"**Summary**

* Tesla's stock remains overvalued despite disappointing vehicle delivery numbers and slowing growth.
* The surge in Tesla's stock price is driven by enthusiasm for AI advancements, Elon Musk's charisma, and Donald Trump's election victory rather than improvements in the company's core business fundamentals.
* At 126 times projected earnings, Tesla’s valuation is far higher than both industry peers and even Nvidia, making it increasingly difficult to justify its current price.
* The company's challenges, including declining deliveries, suggest that much of its upside potential has already been priced in.
* Investors should consider taking profits while the stock is trading at near-record highs.

Tesla’s stock has been riding a wave of unprecedented enthusiasm, with its price reaching all-time highs despite recently published delivery numbers that fell short of analysts' expectations. This discrepancy highlights a growing disconnect between Tesla’s market valuation and its actual performance. The company, once known for its relentless growth and innovation, delivered fewer cars in 2024 than in 2023, marking its first-ever year of declining deliveries. Despite this, Tesla’s stock price has surged by 63% in 2024, demonstrating how much investor sentiment rather than fundamental growth is driving its valuation.

In my October analysis, I discussed how Tesla’s slowing delivery growth and declining net income, despite aggressive price cuts, were becoming evident concerns. Even the highly anticipated robotaxi event failed to deliver the excitement that investors had hoped for, leading to a drop in the stock price at the time. While Tesla was already trading at a premium then, its valuation has only become more stretched in the months since.

The most recent data on Tesla’s deliveries reveals troubling trends. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company delivered 495,570 vehicles, falling short of the 512,300 deliveries expected by analysts. This shortfall contributed to a total of 1.79 million vehicles delivered for the year, a slight decline from the 1.81 million delivered in 2023. While the drop in deliveries may seem modest, it is significant as it breaks Tesla’s streak of consistent year-over-year growth, which had previously been a hallmark of its success. This is especially notable given the company’s reliance on vehicle sales for approximately 80% of its revenue. Without sustained growth in this area, the rationale for holding Tesla as a growth stock diminishes considerably.

From 2020 to 2023, Tesla experienced remarkable growth in deliveries, with annual numbers climbing steadily. However, 2024 marked a departure from this trend, with sales stagnating and then declining. Quarterly delivery figures also highlight the slowdown, with growth peaking in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently stalling. This lack of growth is especially concerning for a company that reinvests all earnings into future expansion rather than paying dividends to shareholders. Tesla’s business model hinges on its ability to grow continuously, and the absence of that growth undermines its investment appeal.

Despite these challenges, Tesla’s stock has soared, buoyed by investor excitement over its advancements in artificial intelligence, Elon Musk’s magnetic persona, and the political implications of Donald Trump’s recent election victory. Musk has repeatedly emphasized Tesla’s position as a leader in AI and robotics, which has further fueled optimism among investors. Additionally, Tesla’s stock experienced significant gains following the November election, with investors speculating that Trump’s administration might ease regulations related to self-driving technology. However, such regulatory changes would only be beneficial if Tesla achieves full autonomy, an ambitious milestone that remains elusive.

Tesla’s valuation underscores the risks of the current enthusiasm. The stock is now trading at an extraordinary 126 times projected earnings, a multiple that far exceeds even AI powerhouse Nvidia, which trades at around 42 times earnings. Comparisons with legacy automakers further highlight the disparity. Tesla’s market cap of $1.2 trillion is greater than that of the next 20 largest automakers combined, yet it delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than in 2023. This disconnect raises questions about whether Tesla’s valuation can be justified in the absence of tangible growth.

Tesla’s performance relative to Nvidia provides another perspective on the stock’s overvaluation. While both companies have benefited from their association with AI, Tesla’s stock has outperformed Nvidia’s despite facing significant headwinds in its core business. This suggests that investor enthusiasm for Tesla may be outpacing its actual achievements.

Although Tesla remains a leader in EV production and is recognized for its innovative technologies, including AI and robotics, these factors are already priced into the stock. The company’s market leadership positions it well to benefit from long-term trends in EV adoption, but its challenges in the short term, including declining deliveries and uncertain profitability from new ventures, make its current valuation appear precarious.

In conclusion, Tesla’s stock is trading at unsustainable levels given its recent performance. While the company’s technological advancements and market leadership are undeniable, its reliance on investor sentiment rather than business fundamentals makes it a risky investment at these prices. Taking profits now would allow investors to capitalize on the stock’s near-record highs while avoiding potential losses should the market reassess Tesla’s valuation. While the enthusiasm surrounding Tesla may persist in the short term, prudence suggests that this is an opportune moment to exit the position.

840,1hvcot5,2025-01-06 23:04:40,This is why we dont buy Chinese stocks: US Dept of Defense Labels Tencent a military company ,"
From [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline?embedded-checkout=true):

The U.S. Department of Defense has added Tencent Holdings and CATL to its blacklist of companies allegedly linked to China's military, causing Tencent's U.S.-listed shares to drop nearly 10%. This move is part of the Pentagon's ""Section 1260H list,"" which now names 134 firms believed to support China's military-civil fusion strategy, where civilian tech is leveraged for military purposes.

Tencent, known for WeChat and major gaming investments, has denied the allegations and plans to work with U.S. authorities to clear up what it calls a misunderstanding. Similarly, CATL, a key supplier of EV batteries to Tesla, Ford, and BMW, refuted the claims, calling their inclusion a mistake and stating they have no involvement in military activities.

While the designation doesn't impose immediate sanctions, it signals increased risk for U.S. investors and partners. Companies previously added to this list, like DJI, have faced serious business disruptions, including bans and reputational hits.

Both Tencent and CATL are expected to challenge the decision, but this adds to the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. Investors should keep an eye on this situation as it could impact these stocks and broader U.S.-China market relations.

Be a Hidden Gem and at a Place When Tesla Was at $1.33 Only or When Bitcoin was but Mere Cents Only?,"Hi investing friends, could GOEV (Canoo inc., I've bought quite a significant number of shares at least significant for the budget; always with cross-referencing do your own research and trust your own instincts after the data, always doing due diligence and this is not financial advice) be a hidden gem and now at a place when Tesla was at $1.33 or when BTC was mere cents (Bitcoin even started at $0) about a decade and a half ago?

It's always tough to see looking forward (it's always looking back of course that one see gems that could be hidden), though I always look at who's creating what, who's the real leader and Canoo's leader seems maybe a few percentages of Elon Musk. 

The Canoo founder has a lot of patents it seems, innovative it seem similar to Elon (but not as big like Elon's pre-Tesla and SpaceX, like PayPal or Zip2) had a successful venture (Solera I think). 

But only time will tell if the pattern will repeat itself with Canoo, it has a great design, innovative, especially their MPDV (I wish that was the one they focused on but had a smaller non-van version with the same). It just needs to launch already their working models (unlike that Nikola truck which even got GM fooled) have amazing design especially the shelf mechanism of their nice looking MPDV. 

If they just did a pre-order which is a genius strategy pioneered by amazing Apple, God-willing they will break through but they also need to upgrade their battery from 200mi to 320mi for good measure. They need to launch now coz' the chinese EVs are coming with tariffs by Pres. Trump or not- it's like 'finished or not finished pass your papers.'

But I still think the company is very overvalued. I would think 250 is a fair value or maybe even less. 

Let's be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for Elon Musk not bcs the company has an economic moat.

So the question we need to ask ourselves is: will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly I do not think so. Bunch of recent tweets were pretty controversial and all that but I feel like this won't have any further impact atm. I just read they are recently started production on the newest Y model and it's supposed to be available in early 2025 so this might actually push the price up until then.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

849,1h28t5b,2024-11-28 23:44:37,Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

852,1h70pbp,2024-12-05 04:21:36,Tesla: Unveiling the Overvaluation—A Comprehensive Analysis. Short Seller Report. (TSLA) Stock Equity Investing,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has emerged as one of the most polarizing entities in contemporary financial history, boasting a market capitalization surpassing the combined worth of established automakers such as Toyota, Ford, and General Motors. Although the company has undeniably transformed the automotive and energy sectors, our analysis indicates that Tesla's valuation is driven by speculative enthusiasm rather than enduring fundamentals.

This report highlights substantial concerns regarding Tesla's financial performance, competitive positioning, and speculative projects such as the Optimus robot. Utilizing a macroeconomic perspective, it incorporates the Buffett Indicator and Shiller P/E Ratio to position Tesla within a broader market bubble. Our analysis concludes that Tesla is overvalued by nearly every metric, presenting a strong case for re-evaluating investment in the company.

**Disconnect from Fundamentals** P/E and Market Multiples 

Tesla's valuation metrics are inflated to speculative levels, outpacing both its peers and historical precedents: 

**Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (TTM):** Tesla’s Price-to-Earnings stands at **94.55**, far above the automotive industry average of 5-15. For context, NVIDIA (a high-growth tech company) trades at 62x, and Apple, with its mature, stable business model, trades at 30x. Even against leading tech companies, Tesla’s P/E ratio is disproportionately high. 

**Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:** Tesla trades at 8.95x sales, while Toyota and Ford hover below 1x. By comparison, NVIDIA’s P/S is approximately 16x, justified by its dominance in high-margin, rapidly expanding AI markets. Tesla’s lower-margin automotive business does not command the same pricing power or scalability, making its P/S ratio harder to justify. 

**Enterprise Value to EBITDA:** Tesla’s EV/EBITDA: 81.72, significantly higher than traditional automakers like GM (\~7x) and Toyota (\~6x). 

Tech Companies EV/EBITDA: 

* NVIDIA (NVDA): \~41x (Q4 2024), driven by its dominance in AI and GPUs. 
* Apple (AAPL): \~24x (Q4 2024), reflecting its mature, high-margin ecosystem.

These valuations assume extraordinary growth and profitability far beyond what Tesla has demonstrated or is likely to achieve given intensifying competitive pressures and technological limitations. 

**Current Market Cap to GDP Ratio**: The Buffett Indicator stands at **208%**, indicating an extreme overvaluation of the U.S. stock market. Tesla’s significant influence within major indices intensifies this systemic risk.

**Shiller P/E Ratio Current S&P 500 CAPE:** At 36.5, the CAPE ratio is nearing levels seen before the dot-com bust and 1929 crash. Tesla’s inflated valuation amplifies the broader market distortion. 

**Financial Performance Analysis** 

Revenue Growth Deceleration Tesla’s revenue growth trajectory is losing momentum: Annual Growth Decline: From **51.35% in 2022 to 18.8%** **in 2023**. Quarterly Revenue Stagnation: Q3 2024 revenue of $25.18 billion represents a sequential decline of 1.25%. **Margin Compression** Tesla's once-dominant margins are eroding under competitive and operational pressures: **Gross Margin:** Dropped to **18.25%** in 2023, reflecting price cuts and rising input costs. **Operating Margin**: Declined to **9.19%**, signaling inefficiencies in scaling operations.

Tesla's profitability is heavily reliant on high-margin regulatory credit sales. Regulatory Credit Dependency Tesla earned $1.78 billion from regulatory credits in 2023, representing 1.8% of revenue but an outsized share of net income. As traditional automakers ramp up EV production, the demand for Tesla's credits will wane, threatening this vital income stream. 

Policy Risk: Potential deregulation under a new administration, such as Donald Trump’s rollback of EV mandates, could eliminate this revenue entirely. 

Free Cash Flow Volatility Annual **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: Declined by **42.38%** YoY to $4.36 billion in 2023. CapEx Expansion: **Capital expenditures** surged to **$3.5 billion in Q3 2024**, reflecting heavy investments with uncertain ROI. 

Competitive Positioning: Eroding Leadership Market Share Under Siege Tesla’s once-dominant EV market share is eroding as competitors scale production: 

* BYD (China): Outpaced Tesla in global EV sales with a diversified, cost-efficient lineup. 
* Ford and GM (U.S.): Successfully launching competitive models like the F-150 Lightning and Chevy Bolt EUV. 

Volkswagen Group (Europe): Scaling production of the ID series to challenge Tesla in key markets. Limited Product Lineup Tesla offers only four primary models: Model S, 3, X, and Y. Delays in the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi have limited its ability to address growing demand for EV trucks and commercial vehicles. 

**Technological Limitations: The Autonomy Gap** 

Tesla's reliance on a Level 2 autonomous system, marketed as ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD), raises significant safety concerns. Unlike its competitors, Tesla has faced public scrutiny and legal challenges over a troubling number of fatalities and accidents associated with its Autopilot and FSD systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is limited to **SAE Level 2**, requiring constant driver supervision. Despite its branding as ""Full Self-Driving,"" Tesla's system lags behind competitors who are deploying higher levels of autonomy. Competitors Advancing in Autonomy 

* Waymo (**Alphabet**): Operating **Level 4** autonomous vehicles in urban and suburban environments, Waymo leverages a robust sensor suite, including lidar, radar, and cameras, to achieve safe, driverless navigation. 
   * Despite millions of miles driven in autonomous mode, Waymo has not reported any fatal accidents involving its vehicles. The company’s use of lidar, radar, and stringent testing protocols prioritizes safety above all else.
*  Cruise (**General Motors**): Similarly deploying **Level 4** autonomous vehicles, Cruise has demonstrated fully driverless operations in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. 
   * Similarly, Cruise operates its autonomous fleet in complex urban environments without any recorded fatalities. Rigorous validation and oversight underpin its commitment to safety. 

**Mercedes-Benz**: Achieved **Level 3** autonomy, allowing drivers to disengage under specific conditions, and is actively scaling this capability in key markets like Germany.

* As a pioneer in achieving Level 3 autonomy, Mercedes-Benz adheres to strict European safety standards. The company has not been implicated in fatal incidents linked to its autonomous technology. 

**Tesla's Refusal to Adopt Lidar**: A Strategic Misstep Lidar, a gold standard for environmental perception in autonomous vehicles, is absent from Tesla’s sensor suite. While Tesla relies solely on cameras and neural networks, this approach limits its ability to detect objects with the precision and reliability required for higher levels of autonomy. Lidar offers redundancy and reliability in adverse conditions, such as poor weather or low visibility. Tesla’s omission of lidar raises safety and regulatory risks. 

Regulatory Roadblocks: Tesla's current system may struggle to meet the stringent safety standards required for **Level 4 or 5 autonomy**. The Business Model Constraint Tesla's refusal to adopt lidar is not solely technological—it is economic. Adding lidar would dramatically **increase production costs**, undermining Tesla’s ability to maintain competitive pricing in a margin-sensitive market. 

Cost Implications: The inclusion of lidar could add $1,000 to $2,000 per vehicle in hardware costs alone, compressing Tesla’s **already declining gross margins**. 

Reliance on Low Costs: Tesla’s market position **depends on producing vehicles at a relatively low cost**. Embracing lidar and other advanced sensors would necessitate higher vehicle prices or **reduced profitability**—both untenable given Tesla’s current valuation pressures. Tesla Will Struggle to Deliver a High-Quality, Level 5 Vehicle Tesla’s business model prioritizes cost efficiency over technological advancement. This approach limits Tesla’s ability to compete with high-quality offerings from rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Waymo. This makes the realization of a Level 5 fully autonomous vehicle—the holy grail of autonomy—highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. While also ensuring Tesla will continue to deliver lower-quality vehicles compared to competitors who balance advanced technology with rigorous quality standards. Tesla's technological and economic constraints reveal a fundamental flaw in its autonomy strategy. While competitors like Waymo, Cruise, and Mercedes-Benz lead the charge toward true self-driving vehicles, Tesla remains limited by its cost-driven model, prioritizing affordability over technological robustness. This gap will only widen as regulatory demands for safety and precision increase, further eroding Tesla’s competitive edge in the autonomy race. 

**Speculative Ventures: The Optimus Robot and Financial Impossibilities** Tesla’s foray into humanoid robotics through the Optimus project exemplifies speculative spending on unproven technologies. While CEO Elon Musk has branded Optimus as a revolutionary product that will transform industries, the financial and technological hurdles are insurmountable given Tesla’s existing commitments. 

Development Stage: Early and Unimpressive Current Optimus prototypes remain far from market ready. Demonstrations reveal robots controlled remotely, lacking the autonomy necessary to perform even basic tasks reliably. Musk has claimed Optimus will perform functions ranging from warehouse labor to elder care, yet no substantial evidence supports the viability of this vision in the near term. 

Competition: Boston Dynamics’ Atlas Robot: Years ahead in functionality and autonomy, Atlas showcases capabilities like complex navigation, load handling, and task performance, including construction-related activities. Tesla lags far behind established players like Boston Dynamics, whose decades-long focus on robotics has yielded tangible results. 

Optimus, in its current form, appears more akin to a marketing spectacle than a functional product. 

Tesla’s ability to deliver a viable Optimus robot, while maintaining profitability and fulfilling its other ambitious promises (such as Level 5 autonomy), faces significant financial constraints: 

**High Production Costs**: The estimated Bill of Materials (BOM) for Optimus is $50,000-$60,000 per unit, with components like robotic hands costing upwards of $10,000 alone. Scaling production to mass-market levels without compromising profitability would require unprecedented efficiency improvements, which Tesla has not demonstrated in its automotive business. 

Lack of Focus: Tesla is already grappling with **slowing vehicle sales**, **declining margins**, and the **high capital expenditure needed for its core EV business**. Simultaneously pursuing **Level 5 autonomy** and **humanoid robotics** is **financially and operationally unsustainable**. The Conflict Between FSD, Vehicles, and Optimus Tesla’s current valuation assumes success across multiple frontiers—producing low-cost vehicles, achieving full Level 5 autonomy, and scaling humanoid robotics. However, these goals are mutually exclusive given Tesla’s financial and technical limitations.

Level 5 Autonomy Challenges: Achieving this milestone requires heavy investment in lidar or other advanced sensor technologies that Tesla has eschewed to preserve margins. Without these investments, FSD remains stuck at Level 2, far behind competitors. 

Vehicle Profitability Risks: Tesla relies on cutting costs in its automotive production to maintain competitiveness. **Diverting resources** to **Optimus** would further strain vehicle **margins** and **reduce its ability to compete** in the increasingly crowded EV market. Successfully building Optimus at scale would demand massive R&D expenditures, high production costs, and extensive testing—placing further pressure on Tesla’s finances. 

Financial Risks to Shareholders Elon Musk’s vision for Optimus, paired with Tesla’s ongoing promises of Level 5 autonomy and affordable EVs, creates a trifecta of expectations that cannot be achieved simultaneously.

Investor Dilution Risk: Funding these speculative ventures may necessitate raising capital, diluting shareholder equity further. **Profitability at Risk**: Optimus development would drain resources needed to maintain Tesla’s **fragile profit margins**, which have already been compressed to **18.25%** **gross** margin in 2023. Credibility Concerns: Years of missed deadlines on promises like Level 5 autonomy raise doubts about Tesla’s ability to deliver on Musk’s bold claims, tarnishing investor confidence over time. **Tesla’s Optimus robot is emblematic of the company’s speculative spending and overpromised vision.** The inherent financial impossibilities of simultaneously scaling Optimus, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and maintaining vehicle profitability underscore a fundamental flaw in Tesla’s business strategy. 

Unlike its competitors, Tesla is spread too thin, risking operational focus, financial stability, and shareholder value. As Musk continues to promise breakthroughs, **the gap between reality and rhetoric only widens, making Tesla’s lofty ambitions increasingly untenable.** Operational Challenges Quality Control Issues Tesla continues to face manufacturing defects and recalls: High Recall Rate: Frequent recalls, including software glitches and mechanical failures, have raised concerns about **production quality.** Customer Complaints: Limited-service centers and long repair times **undermine Tesla’s brand reputation**. Tesla’s competitors have prioritized safety, employing rigorous testing, comprehensive sensor suites (including lidar), and conservative rollout strategies. This stark contrast underscores the risks of Tesla’s cost-cutting approach: **Inventory Build-Up** Tesla’s days of inventory increased to **28 days** in Q3 2024, suggesting weakening demand relative to production levels. 

Tesla has historically been a leader in electric vehicle (EV) battery technology, notably with its high energy density and efficient thermal management systems. However, competitors are rapidly advancing, challenging Tesla's dominance in this critical area. Competitors' Advances in Battery Technology 

* BYD's Blade Battery: BYD's Blade Battery utilizes lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, offering enhanced safety and longevity. Its thin, blade-like design allows for higher energy density and improved space utilization within the vehicle. 
* CATL's Qilin Battery: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) has developed the Qilin battery, which boasts a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg. This enables longer driving ranges and faster charging times. 
* Solid-State Batteries: Companies like Toyota are investing in solid-state battery technology, which promises higher energy density, faster charging, and improved safety over traditional lithium-ion batteries. 

Tesla's introduction of the 4680 battery cells aims to **reduce costs** and improve vehicle range. These cells are larger and designed to be integrated into the vehicle's structure, enhancing efficiency. However, **production challenges have delayed their widespread implementation**, allowing competitors to narrow the technological gap. 

**Impact of Rising Lithium Prices** The EV industry is heavily reliant on lithium, a critical component in battery production. Recent trends indicate a significant increase in lithium prices due to supply constraints and escalating demand. **Lithium carbonate prices have surged, reaching unprecedented levels.** This escalation is attributed to the rapid growth in EV adoption and limited expansion in lithium extraction and processing capacities. Supply Constraints: The **International Energy Agency (IEA) warns of potential lithium shortages by 2025**, which could hinder the scaling of EV production globally. Implications for Tesla Cost Pressures: **Rising lithium prices directly impact battery production costs**. For Tesla, which aims to produce mass-market EVs at competitive prices, these **cost increases** could **compress profit margins** or necessitate higher vehicle prices, potentially reducing demand. 

Tesla's ambitious production targets may be jeopardized by lithium supply bottlenecks, leading to potential delays in vehicle deliveries and an inability to meet market demand. While Tesla remains a significant player in the EV market, its lead in battery technology is being challenged by competitors' innovations. Coupled with the financial pressures from rising lithium prices and potential supply shortages, Tesla faces substantial challenges in maintaining its competitive edge and profitability in the evolving EV landscape. 

**Legal and Regulatory Risks** 

* **Autopilot Investigations**: Multiple NHTSA probes into Autopilot-related accidents could result in costly recalls or fines. 
* **Misleading Marketing Claims:** Lawsuits alleging false advertising of Tesla’s FSD capabilities pose reputational and financial risks. Tesla’s valuation is built on speculative optimism that diverges significantly from its financial and operational realities. The company faces a convergence of critical challenges: 
* **Slowing Revenue Growth and Margin Compression**: Revenue growth has decelerated, while declining gross and operating margins highlight the financial strain of maintaining competitive pricing amidst rising costs. 
* **Reliance on Unsustainable Revenue Streams**: Regulatory credit sales, a key driver of profitability, are vulnerable to policy changes and decreasing demand as competitors ramp up EV production. 
* **Technological and Strategic Constraints**: Tesla’s Level 2 autonomy lags far behind competitors like Waymo and Cruise, who have deployed Level 4 solutions. The company’s refusal to adopt lidar reflects cost-driven compromises that limit its ability to achieve higher levels of safety and autonomy. 
* **Speculative Ventures:** The Optimus robot project exemplifies Tesla’s foray into high-risk, unproven technologies. Building and scaling Optimus while pursuing Level 5 autonomy and maintaining profitability is financially and operationally implausible. 
* **Eroding Market Position**: Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is waning, with competitors like BYD, Volkswagen, and GM offering cost-effective and innovative alternatives that threaten Tesla’s market share. 
* **Safety and Reputational Risks**: Fatalities linked to Tesla’s Autopilot underscore the dangers of overpromising and underdelivering, contrasting sharply with the safer, more transparent approaches of competitors. 
* **Challenges in Battery Technology**: While Tesla has historically led in battery innovation, competitors like BYD, CATL, and Toyota are closing the gap with advanced technologies like the Blade and Qilin batteries, as well as solid-state innovations. Production delays and scaling issues with Tesla’s 4680 cells further erode its competitive edge. 
* **Rising Costs of Key Commodities**: The surge in lithium prices and potential shortages of critical materials like cobalt and nickel threaten to increase production costs and compress margins. For Tesla, which relies on aggressive pricing to sustain demand, this adds a significant financial burden. 
* **Macro indicators such as the Buffett Indicator (208% of GDP) and the Shiller P/E Ratio (36.5)** place Tesla’s valuation within the context of broader market overvaluation, further amplifying the risk of a correction. 

Tesla’s ability to sustain its valuation assumes simultaneous success in producing low-cost vehicles, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and scaling speculative projects like Optimus—all while maintaining profitability and navigating intensifying competition. This multifaceted challenge is not only improbable but also exposes shareholders to significant downside risk. 

As competitors advance technologically, diversify product offerings, and secure more efficient supply chains, Tesla’s vulnerabilities become increasingly evident. Combined with macroeconomic pressures and systemic overvaluation, Tesla’s stock is poised for significant correction, making it a high-risk holding for investors.

Thanks to anyone who replies. I saw that Musk is apparently under fire for offloading $7.5B of stock (I think in 2022) during a time when he knew that the company wouldn't meet its targets. He also assured investors that it would be a great end to the year, despite knowing the opposite and selling stock.

I'm somewhat ignorant of the legal specifics, and I'm more curious about that than the actual Musk situation. I know insider trading is illegal, but if you're a CEO or other exec and you know your stock is about to take a hit, are you legally required to maintain your position and take the same proportional losses as any other investor?

Also, to avoid getting caught, why don't CEOs allow themselves to take very minor losses and then sell? I'm not advocating that, I'm just genuinely curious. It seems like a sketchy choice to sell so much stock without incurring losses when losses are incurred by others so shortly after. If a CEO rides a loss for just a little bit and **then** sells before everyone else (who lacks the CEO's insider knowledge) is that still insider trading?

  
Edit: On a scale of 1 (Rather Questionable) to 10 (Boldfaced Securities Fraud), how would you rank this situation? People seem to have mixed opinions. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d8tzac/musktesla_insider_trading_question/

856,1dulktf,2024-07-03 18:30:33,Tesla Set for a New Bull Run as Deliveries Turn Around and Energy Storage Powers the AI Era,"Whenever investors are disappointed with Tesla, Elon Musk surprises short sellers with a big move. On Tuesday, Tesla posted stronger-than-expected Q2 deliveries, hinting at a turning point for weak demand, with an upside in Q3 deliveries. Additionally, energy storage deployments doubled quarter-over-quarter, potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with AI. These factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of Tesla bulls.

Thanks to these developments, Tesla surged over 10% on Tuesday, with its market value reaching $737.5 billion, maintaining a six-day rally, and breaking another resistance level, which is always a bullish sign. From April's low, Tesla shares are now up 67%.

**Q2 Deliveries Slightly Exceed Expectations Amid Record June Deliveries from Chinese EV Makers, Zero-Interest Car Purchases Expected to Drive Crazy Q3 Demand**

According to Tesla's delivery data released on Tuesday, the company delivered 440,000 new vehicles in Q2, down 4.8% year-over-year but up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and better than the market's expectation of 439,300 vehicles. The total production in Q2 was about 411,000 cars, resulting in a delivery-production gap of 33,000 cars, compared to -46,000 cars in the previous quarter (where more cars were produced, leading to some inventory remaining). Tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of German factories and the Red Sea conflict, which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short-term supply struggles to meet demand, which is obviously more exciting than excess supply.

Considering that Chinese EV makers such as NIO, ZEEKR, and Leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in June, this implies a significant recovery in demand for Tesla. The company also launched a major campaign on Monday, introducing five-year zero interest financing for Model 3/Y and other preferential policies.

Specifically, users who place an order before and including July 31 can avail themselves of a no-down-payment deal: with an initial down payment of 79,900 yuan (10,990 dollars), the daily installment for the Model 3 RWD and Long Range AWD will be as low as 85 yuan and 107 yuan respectively (12 and 15 dollars for each), while the Model Y RWD and Long Range will be as low as 95 yuan and 118 yuan per day. Users who make a down payment of 45,900 yuan (6,300 dollars) can opt for a five-year low-interest plan (starting at an annualized rate of 0.93%).

The Chinese market accounts for about 22.5% of Tesla's revenue, and if this measure is implemented in other countries in the future, it would indeed be a massive move. This also adds a new narrative for Tesla's Q3 growth.

**Energy Storage Deployment Doubles, Benefitting from AI Era**

Both NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have pointed out that the future development of artificial intelligence is closely related to energy and storage. While Tesla's AI business has yet to show tangible benefits, its energy storage business is poised to become a pillar of AI in the future.

Tesla reported that it deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products in Q2, setting a new record for quarterly deployment, more than double the 4 GWh in Q1, and the company's energy storage deployments in the first half of the year almost matched the total for last year.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas praised, ""As Gen AI acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand, electricity generation, and data center investment, we believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy, which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business is uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the U.S. electric grid accelerated by the AI boom.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1dulktf/tesla_set_for_a_new_bull_run_as_deliveries_turn/

I recently took a swing with Rivian. Although they have a lot of risk (tight cash, lots of debt), I do believe the excitement around their products give them a lot of leverage to raise more cash if and when they need it, or entice a partnership with another major tech company.

[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) briefly passed [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) in market cap on Wednesday during intraday trading as the chipmaker emerges as the primary beneficiary of the [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. If it holds until the close, it will be the second most valuable U.S. company.

Nvidia hit a [$3 trillion market cap](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-briefly-passes-3-trillion-market-cap-on-back-of-ai-boom.html) milestone during intraday trading. Nvidia had a market value of $3.007 trillion at one point, versus Apple’s, which stood at $3.005 trillion.

Nvidia shares have risen over 24% since the company [reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html) in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, on which big tech companies spend billions.

Investors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidia’s huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% in a year to $22.6 billion in sales, about 86% of the company’s overall revenue.

Meanwhile, Apple shares are only about 5% this year, as Apple’s sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing, and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro.

Apple was the first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion market caps. It has frequently been the most valuable U.S. company over the past few years but was again [passed by Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/) earlier this year. Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia.

Nvidia’s stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.

Nvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising over 3,290% in the past five years.

These are the things I will be watching this year, to continue to add to my position, or to see if I should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 

1. Nearing profitability.  Rivian has recently re-affirmed that by Q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. They are expected to deliver just over 50,000 vehicles for the year. That is a combination of mostly R1S and R1T with some of the Amazon delivery vans. If there guidance is correct, and they either meet or beat q4 '24 earnings, it is a bullish sign.

  
2. $6 Billion loan from Uncle Sam. Now the new administration does create a bit of tension here.  The new ""DOGE"" agency is going to be cutting Gov. spending across the board. There is some concern they will take away this loan that the Biden administration had given to Rivian. While this is certainly a possibility, I do not think it is going to happen. I think it would be a very bad look politically, and would give strength to the argument musk will us his Gov. connections to attack his competitors. Because of that, I think this money is safely staying with Rivian.  If it turns out DOGE is going to back down from this threat, that is another bullish sign.

  
3. VW Rivian joint venture. VW NA is about to change, they are getting a new CEO, Kjell Gruner, who previously was the President and CEO of Porsche Cars of North America and then moved to Rivian to be there ""Chief Commercial Officer & President, Business Growth"".  VW desperatley needs software expertise, and Rivian delivers that in spades. That combined with VWs massive buying and production power, is a strong match. This is a bullish sign right now, and what I think has been pushing to stock upwards. 

VW has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits.  The introduction of the old/new Scout brand, that looks mighty similar to Rivians R2 concepts. As well as confirming the deal with Rivian, it looks like they're finally going to start to take serious steps to rebuilding their reputation, especially in NA. 

  
4. Rivians customers are happy, and according to a recent Consumer Reports Survey, 86% of owners say they would buy a Rivian again, better than Tesla. If they are happy with their purchase, they will talk to their other wealthy friends about their Rivian, word of mouth is very powerful.

  
5. The inevitable Tesla Comparison. RIVIAN IS NOT TESLA. Now obviously Tesla the company in 2024 is very different to Tesla the company in 2015. Back in 2015 it was the 3rd year of Model S production and the first of Model X. 

in 2015 Tesla sold just over 50,000 Model S. Now in 2023, just two years after the Rivian R1T debuted, Rivian sold just over 47,000 vehicles. I think Tesla in 2015 is more of a fair comparison to Rivian now in 2024, but Tesla now in 2024 is not so comparable to Rivian now in 2024.

The company has announced a reduction of over 14,000 jobs worldwide, particularly impacting its major operations in the U.S. and China.

Elon attributes these layoffs to a drop in sales and increasing competition in the EV market. This decision is reflective of broader challenges facing the industry, not just Tesla. A recent analysis indicates a significant reduction in job postings among leading EV manufacturers over the past three months. This trend could be an early indicator of the challenges that lie ahead for the sector, suggesting a possible reevaluation of growth strategies among these companies.

I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.

https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e

The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.

So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold. 

So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049. 

Here is my list so far. 

1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 )
2. Costco
3. Johnson and Johnson
4. Waste Management
5. CVS
6. Home Depot
7. Boeing
8. Caterpillar
9. GE Aerospace
10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia
11. Walmart/Target
12. Starbucks / McDonalds
13. UPS
14. JP Morgan / Bank of America
15. Berkshire / Markel
16. Disney
17. Tesla / GM
18. Hershey
19. Dollar General
20. Lockheed Martin

Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate. 

Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.

Edit: Some really good points in the comments. 

1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment 
2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19a10qn/20_stocks_till_2049_buy_and_hold_for_25_years/
872,1hqy8vw,2025-01-01 07:36:43,Bitcoin Isn’t Unique But Infinite—$100K Is Beyond Absurd,"Imagine this: air, the most abundant and freely available resource on Earth. Everyone can breathe it without restriction, it’s everywhere, and it costs nothing. Now, imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles, claiming, “Only 21 million bottles will ever exist.” They sell the bottles, marketing them as rare and special, and soon, the price of a single bottle soars to $100,000.

But here’s the catch: anyone can grab the same air, bottle it themselves, impose their own arbitrary limits, and sell it too. The air inside these bottles is identical, same purity, same ability to sustain life. Yet somehow, the original company convinces people their air is unique, while the others are dismissed as worthless. This isn’t just absurd but comically irrational. And yet, it’s a perfect analogy for Bitcoin.

Think about it: bottling air to sell is ridiculous. Why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available? Worse, imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system—one consuming massive amounts of electricity, requiring complex networks, and involving global participants—to package, transfer, and store this bottled air. This is the level of absurdity we reach with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s defenders often point to its decentralization, anonymity, and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. But what is this decentralized system really securing? Digital air. The units being produced, transferred, and protected represent nothing—they are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. Anyone with the technical knowledge can clone Bitcoin’s code, impose their own arbitrary cap, and launch their own cryptocurrency.

This brings us to the critical difference between Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies: cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless.

Stocks represent ownership in a company. A company cannot be copied like a piece of code. The value of a share is tied to the performance, assets, and operations of that unique entity. You cannot clone Tesla or Apple, and therefore, you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. Stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite, tied to real-world assets, operations, and innovation.

Fiat currencies, on the other hand, represent units of debt. They are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers—companies, governments, or individuals—to repay them. Banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real-world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. No one can walk into a bank and request a trillion-dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it.

Cryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. If you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow, nothing stops you. Bitcoin’s 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the Bitcoin protocol, adjust the parameters, and produce trillions of coins in their own system. In this way, cryptocurrencies represent nothing—no ownership, no debt, no tangible connection to the real economy. They are the digital equivalent of bottling air, infinitely replicable with no inherent value.

Bitcoin’s defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable, likening it to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin’s scarcity is artificial and replicable. Limiting Bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming, “We’re only producing 21 million bottles.” The air is still abundant, and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits.

The absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing, transferring, and storing these digital tokens. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations, and yet what is being protected? A digital representation of air, something freely available, infinitely replicable, and ultimately meaningless.

Bitcoin’s price doesn’t reflect the value of its features. If decentralization, anonymity, and security were truly valuable, Bitcoin’s clones, many of which improve on these features, would share its valuation. Instead, Bitcoin’s price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. People aren’t paying $100,000 because Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency; they’re paying because they believe someone else will pay more.

This speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin’s features are infinitely replicable, and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost, the illusion will collapse.

Bitcoin isn’t digital gold, nor is it a revolutionary asset. It’s a digital air, packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100,000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost.

When the hype fades, and the absurdity of the system becomes clear, Bitcoin’s price will plummet, leaving behind the inescapable truth: no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hqy8vw/bitcoin_isnt_unique_but_infinite100k_is_beyond/

*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.

**The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are: Adobe (ADBE), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Chipotle (CMG), Salesforce (CRM), Door Dash (DASH), Netflix (NFLX), ServiceNow (NOW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Palantir (PLTR), Shopify (SHOP), Sofi Bank (SOFI), Uber (UBER)

---

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

I'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).

883,1hkr1z4,2024-12-23 16:12:33,"When Tech Eventually Fizzles, Will U.S. Continue to Dominate? Backtesting Excluding Tech vs. Global Markets","Edit: People are misunderstanding the question. I’m not bearish on tech. It’s more of a question of US continuing to out perform the global market once the expected returns on tech slows.

TL;DR: As tech’s strong performance fades (maybe it doesn’t, but eventually, it might), why should we believe the U.S. market will continue to outperform globally? Has anyone already backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech—especially the “Magnificent 7”—and compared its performance to developed and emerging markets?

Over the past 15 years, the U.S. market has massively outperformed global equities, leading to the narrative that U.S. governance, monetary policy, the strength of the dollar (as the global reserve currency), and favorable geopolitical conditions will continue to support this dominance. This view is widely accepted in this community (you can find tons of discussions on this by searching “international” here if you haven’t already).

However, the primary driver of U.S. outperformance has been the tech sector, particularly the “Magnificent 7” (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta). A quick search shows that these companies have been responsible for a significant portion of U.S. market returns over the past two decades, with tech alone contributing heavily to the growth of the S&P 500.

But what happens when the tech sector eventually hits a slowdown or correction? While it could continue to dominate for another decade, at some point, the market may shift, and another sector or region could rise to prominence. So, if tech (especially the Magnificent 7) loses its edge, what is left to support U.S. market dominance?

I’m particularly interested in whether anyone has backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech stocks (especially the MAG 7) and compared its performance against global markets—both developed and emerging. Excluding the top tech names from the S&P 500 could provide a more realistic view of the underlying market performance without the distortion caused by these mega-cap stocks, which are arguably overvalued or at least priced for significant future growth.

I’m asking this because, as a long-term, passive investor, I think the MAG 7 may be overvalued, and their strong returns over the past 15 years might not be sustainable. To further diversify my portfolio, I’ve begun investing in US mid and small-cap S&P funds, but I’m also looking to increase my exposure to global equities. From what I can see, excluding tech from the equation, international equities don’t appear to underperform as much relative to U.S. stocks. So, I’m interested in seeing if global diversification, especially in emerging markets, would still yield solid returns after this adjustment.

A few questions I have:
Has anyone conducted a backtest or analysis of the S&P 500’s performance excluding the Magnificent 7? How does it compare to global markets, particularly developed and emerging markets?

If tech returns eventually fizzle out (or at least grow more slowly), should we expect the U.S. to continue outperforming? What other sectors or factors might drive U.S. market growth in the future?

This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*

I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. 

**Investment strategy:**

1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  
2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  
3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  
4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*

I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.

**Looking forward:**

Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!

890,1dj6opn,2024-06-19 01:01:44,Selling NVDA with $1m gains,"I’ve decided I’m going to sell a portion of my Nvidia stock once I hit $1million profit. As of close today, I need an additional 22% increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down/correct.    

A little back story, I bought my first shares in Feb  2017 for $2.77 and again in October for $4.86.  I’ve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars.  Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world.  

My total cost basis is $34k and I’m sitting right around $850k.  Gains are around 2600% which is insane.  

I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I’m a bit torn on actually selling any of it.  If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn’t be sitting on the gains I have today.  My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into.  I’m also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0% which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup.  As with any compounding interest, once the snowball gets to this point, smaller 2-5% moves really move the needle (in both directions).  

Anyways, just want to share this with someone since I can’t really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship.  It’s anyone’s real guess what will happen with Nvidia in the future so I can’t imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade.  I’ve experienced similar gains on Tesla but failed to sell at the top and now only have a portion of my gains on that stock so I know when a bubble feels like a bubble and this is definitely in that territory now.

# Realized (sold)

**2023 Totals**

* **Affirm (AFRM):** +18.09%
* **Allbirds (BIRD):** +6.89%
* **Coinbase (COIN):** +6.42%
* **Carvana (CVNA):** +845.57%

* **Shopify (SHOP):** +51.27%
* **Snapchat (SNAP):** -1.99%
* **Unity (U):** +27.57%

All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). 

Peloton was a big loser and the only one I almost immediately regretted, but it was a relatively small investment that was more than offset by others. 

**2024 YTD**

* **Roblox (RBLX):** +42.66%
* **Snowflake (SNOW):** +51.57%
* **Unity (U):** -8.73%

* **Shopify (SHOP):** +46.37%
* **Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM):** +60.76%

**Purchased in the last week/month**

I had extra cash, so I purchased small amounts of these in the last week or so: 

* **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** -2.98%
* **ARM (ARM):** -1.88%
* **Intel (INTC):** -1.42%
* **Microsoft (MSFT):** +2.32%
* **Tesla (TSLA):** -0.54%

I know these are all less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. 

# Rate of return

The total rate of return since inception (June 2022 to May 2024) is **77.90%**. 

# 3 ways my investing evolved

I’m still well within the ‘maybe I’m just lucky’ phase since it’s only been a couple years, but I’ve noticed I invest differently now than I have in the past: 

1. Insight 
2. Conviction 
3. Patience

**Insight**

I’ve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views). 

Ben Graham’s quote rings true: 

>“In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”

Perhaps counterintuitively, I’ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers. 

Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both. 

# Math

In 2023 I also started practicing math daily (243 days straight as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I’d done any meaningful math. 

I’m not sure how much, but it *feels* like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not. 

**Conviction**

A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term. 

However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths. 

Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I’ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I’m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I’m happy I did. 

A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial. 

This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise, you must seize them.

**Patience**

As a result of my convictions, I’m much more patient in my investing these days and don’t react to the day-to-day.

I opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \~28% (\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \~215%.

(Genuine question!),"I don't know if it's the bubbles I'm in or what social media feeds me, but it seems like everyone is either a high-stakes crypto/AI gambler, or someone who only advocates dumping everything into a basic market index and leaving it forever.

I haven't used the particular tracker before, but I picked the default date ranges and just picked a couple of high-risk plays for a two percent allocation (Bitcoin and Tesla).  I think there's no denying these were highly volatile and highly-valued.  But even if they went to zero it would have a minimal impact on the portfolio.

But the returns were several percent better than VOO/SPDR.  And a 98% VOO +2% high-risk also outperforms BrkB, while being significantly more diversified.

I think anyone who's trying to ""play it safe"" would be ecstatic to beat the market by 3% by only risking 2% of their allocation.

(I haven't tried it but suspect you could have a portfolio of 70% bonds 30% high-risk and do well with a capped drawdown).

902,1hvhjnt,2025-01-07 02:53:11,Uber: A Great Buying Opportunity In Current Markets,"**Summary**

* Uber’s stock is currently undervalued due to market fears surrounding autonomous vehicles, but its robust fundamentals and durable business model make it a highly appealing investment.
* Key strengths include an extensive urban mobility database, loyal user base, and diversified sources of revenue.
* While the rise of self-driving technology presents certain risks, Uber’s strategic alliances, regulatory challenges for competitors, and market dominance ensure it remains well-positioned for sustained growth.
* Even cautious revenue and margin projections suggest considerable upside potential, making Uber an attractive choice with a strong margin of safety.

**The Impact of Market Narratives on Uber's Perception**

Recent announcements have reignited interest in autonomous driving. Tesla (TSLA) revealed plans to launch the Cybercab by 2027, while Google’s Waymo (GOOGL) announced expansion into Miami. These updates have led to a nearly 10% drop in Uber’s stock, contributing to a 15% decline over the past month.

This situation is reminiscent of past market narratives that impacted companies like Google and Meta (META). Both experienced temporary valuation drops due to overblown concerns but ultimately delivered strong returns, supported by solid fundamentals and competent management.

Uber continues to showcase impressive operational growth, strong cash flow, and consistent profitability, all while trading at historically low P/E multiples. These attributes, combined with its moat-driven business model, position Uber as a promising portfolio addition.

**Uber's Competitive Moats and the Importance of Strategic Management**

Uber’s advantages go beyond its network effects. Its unmatched urban mobility database allows for optimized routing, pricing, and seamless connections between users and drivers. Additionally, features like loyalty programs, subscriptions, and brand trust further enhance its competitive position in a sector where reliability and safety are crucial.

Diversification is another critical element in reducing risk. Similar to Google’s evolution beyond search, Uber has created a multifaceted platform that includes logistics and transportation. Delivery accounted for 30% of revenue in Q3, while freight contributed 11%, generating $1.3 billion despite not yet achieving positive EBITDA margins. These emerging segments have the potential to become significant revenue drivers in the future.

Furthermore, Uber’s investments in companies like Grab (GRAB) and DiDi (OTCPK:DIDIY) reflect a strategic approach to balancing profitability and competition. These equity stakes act as a form of optionality while demonstrating Uber’s ability to focus on long-term gains in key regions.

Uber’s management has shown remarkable capability in adapting to industry changes. Much like Meta’s successful redirection of investments, Uber is already positioning itself for the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Partnerships with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta exemplify its ability to integrate self-driving technology while retaining its platform leadership.

**Adapting to Regulations and Long-Term Mobility Trends**

The adoption of self-driving vehicles faces significant hurdles, including regulatory and infrastructure challenges, particularly in emerging markets that are critical to Uber’s business. While major cities like Los Angeles and Miami may adopt autonomous technology sooner, broader implementation is likely to take years, especially in regions such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.

In addition, overarching trends in urban mobility—including cost savings, easing traffic congestion, and the shift from ownership to access—support Uber’s long-term growth. Although the global ride-hailing market is already substantial, it remains underpenetrated in numerous regions, providing opportunities for continued expansion.

**Uber's Resilience Shines Even in Pessimistic Scenarios**

While autonomous vehicles pose potential risks, competition from local apps and evolving regulations may present more immediate challenges to Uber’s margins and market share. Nonetheless, analysts project Uber’s EPS to reach $4 by 2027 and $4.80 by 2028, resulting in P/E multiples of 15x and 12.8x, respectively.

Even under conservative assumptions, Uber’s revenue could exceed $74 billion by 2030, with margins reaching 11.5%. In a more optimistic outlook, margins of 17% would result in a P/E multiple around 10x, equating to an earnings yield of 10%—a compelling figure for a leader in a growing market.

Uber’s forward P/E and free-cash-flow multiples of 21.9x remain attractive given its growth trajectory and low current valuations. With management forecasting strong EBITDA growth and robust free-cash-flow conversion, Uber offers significant upside even if its market valuation remains steady.

**TLDR:** Uber’s long-term outlook remains favorable despite concerns over disruption from self-driving technology. Its diversified operations, strategic investments, and adaptability effectively mitigate potential risks. At its current valuation, Uber represents a strong investment opportunity with substantial potential for long-term shareholder returns.

904,1burmr0,2024-04-03 12:42:50,Is it easy to “beat the market” now?,"Short question, if you invest in the top tech companies, is it easy to beat the marketing meaning the S&P?

We’ve all heard the mantra “you’ll never beat the market” but is that really true any more or does the phrase need some sort of updating?

I’ve been investing for 15 years now and I think I be beat the market or at least the overall S&P500 every single year.  There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it’s significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&P ETF.  My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I’ve always been higher…for over a decade now. 

So hear me out, I’ve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks.  

With a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I’ve found this sector completely destroys the overall “market.” Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it’s very aggressive and very heavily in tech.  

The difference in the S&P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I’ve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I’m still beating the NASDAQ too.  

The contrarian’s argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I’m up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don’t see how the whole world economy wouldn’t fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once.  

I’m not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that.  I’m just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I’m doing?  

Is there a point where the “market” is all tech now?  It sure feels like the S&P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that’s the real underlying answer to my question.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1burmr0/is_it_easy_to_beat_the_market_now/

First of all. Do you think is it realistic that self driving takes over and becomes a normal thing?

With the progress of technology we’re really not that far, fsd 12.3.4 is doing really good and we probably full self driving without supervision could be legal in the next 10-20 years.

If it does, we’ll be having an interesting progress of :

- TSLA : will may be in the top 10; actually they’re selling the self driving as a subscription of 99$ monthly, what if every Tesla owner have this feature?

UBER : if Uber replace all drivers by self driving cars. They’ll be saving all payrolls and injecting it to develop other delivery business (could be drones delivery; maybe I went too far but it’s feasible).  There’s a lot of potential and whatever between 45$-55$ is a good buy price.

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

908,1eac2n8,2024-07-23 16:23:28,Selling of 401k Stock vs Vested stock,"Question for the collective. My company (a fortune 10) offers a 401k which I've been invested in for well over 15 years, in that 401k they are heavily invested well... in themselves.. They also provide stock as part of your bonus each year, so as a result I have a bunch of stock in the 401k and a bunch of stock in my normal portfolio.

  
I'm over invested and continue to find ways to diversify.  Stock is at an all time high and is continuing to climb.

  
Speaking with my financial advisor on possible areas to spread out, he recommended liquidating just the company stock out of my 401k and into another fund we've been discussing over the past few months.

That said, I still have a lot of fully vested stock in my personal stock portfolio from years of bonuses. About 9 months ago, I sold off a lot of my ""Long Held"" (vs short) company stock. But i still have triple the long held stock (in value) in my portfolio vs my 401k.

So my question is (not that i doubt my advisor he's done very well for me) is it better to sell off whats in the 401k and roll it into another fund (which from what i read doesnt take a tax hit but i could be wrong) or should i liquidate more of my long held stock in my portfolio and take the capital gains hit.

In my mind it seems like its a wash except the outcome is more diversification either way I choose.

914,1h2886i,2024-11-28 23:12:45,the TRUTH about investing no one tells you,"# 1. The system is rigged

The financial industry thrives on overcomplicating things to justify fees.

As Charlie Munger said:*""The whole damn system is corrupt... everyone wants easy money, fast. And that requires a big fee.""*

Think about it: there’s **$2 trillion** locked in mutual funds charging **2% fees** while underperforming cheap index funds like the S&P 500. Who’s really winning here? Hint: it’s not us.



# 2. Temperament beats intelligence

Investing isn’t about being the smartest—it’s about controlling your emotions.

* Warren Buffett: *""The most important quality is temperament, not intellect.""*
* I read a study of a fund that averaged an **18% annual return**, but the **average investor in that fund lost money** because they tried to time the market.

**Lesson:** Fear and greed will destroy your portfolio faster than any bad stock pick.



# 3. The S&P 500 is your cheat code

Here’s your free investing hack: **buy the S&P 500 and chill.**

* Low fees.
* Decades of growth.
* Outperforms **98% of funds** consistently.

Even Charlie Munger admits:*""Wealth managers have almost zero chance of beating an unmanaged index like the S&P.""*

So why do people chase stock-picking glory? Because too many investors confuse excitement with success.



# 4. Picking stocks is really hard

Think it’s easy to find the next Tesla? It’s not. And even if you do, good luck getting in before the hype.

* Buffett: *""If you can’t value the stock, you can’t invest in it. You can gamble on it, but you can’t invest.""*
* Most people buying stocks have never even read a balance sheet.

**Picking winners is possible, but it’s incredibly hard—think Charlie Munger-level hard.**

  
**What this all means**

The truth is, the game is rigged for most people to lose. But that doesn’t mean you can’t win.The winners aren’t the ones chasing hype stocks or flexing their ""10-baggers""—they’re the ones quietly compounding wealth by staying disciplined and focusing on what works: **consistency, patience, and a solid strategy.**

920,1hfs25j,2024-12-16 20:02:39,"Reminder: If You Trade More, Wall Street Makes More Money","I've spent a few years reading Warren Buffett and other value investors. Essentially what I learned is that they make money by other people pushing prices too high or too low. Especially when prices become too low, they swoop in and buy a bunch. Next they sit on it a few years until the price goes to the correct valuation again, or preferably after many years when the company deteriorates.

Time and time again, people have predicted that Buffett's strategy will eventually stop working. We nowadays can learn much more etc etc.

Yet, stock prices are all over the place. Tesla doubled in the last 3 months for example. How is that possible? How can a 1T dollar company double in value in 3 months? They still build the same stuff with roughly the same people. Similar for Bitcoin. Also almost doubled in a few months. If that was inevitable according to some metric, then why was it not priced in?

At the same time, there is a common sentiment online that the world is becoming more and more unequal. More wealth accumulates in the hands of a few people.

So let me say this: if you are currently considering buying into some stock that went up recently, please let me remind you that there is only one party that will always make money from your trade. It's not you. It's your broker/Wall Street. They don't care whether you make money or lose money. Some will slam ""price targets"" on stocks if that makes you trade.

926,1hfy0q8,2024-12-17 00:24:17,Ponzi Spotting: a laymen's guide to differentiating investments from Ponzi schemes,"I often see things being called Ponzi schemes on Reddit that are very much not Ponzi schemes. Usually, it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it. Hence, it must be a Ponzi.

I’m going to blow your minds a little bit. 

Almost all (legitimate) investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit. 

Most investable objects, REGARDLESS of what underlies the object, trade at a price on a market. This means, at the margin, some percentage (usually only a small percentage) of the total available supply of the object is trading hands. The trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. Prices are determined by supply and demand. When an investable object goes up in price on a market, it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price, and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price. 

The use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad. It essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded. This includes contracts, stocks, bonds, physical objects, digital objects, etc. 

**Example 1.** You bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990’s. Since it was relatively abundant (still being printed by the company) and Pokemon was relatively new at the time, the supply was high and the demand was low. Fast forward 30 years, Pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining (out of print for decades, many were lost or destroyed through the years). You now are able to sell the charizard for 10,000 dollars to a guy that just got into Pokemon card collecting. Congratulations, you bought low and sold high! Was what you participated in a Ponzi scheme because you (an old investor) made a profit by selling to a new investor?

I really hope your answer to this is no. If you think the answer is yes, you can stop reading here, because I don’t think anything I’m going to say beyond this point is going to help you.

The next step in logic is realizing this charizard example is essentially how ALL INVESTMENT RETURNS are made when the investable object at hand is not providing a direct flow of cash. This is true for non-dividend (which is the vast majority) stocks, derivatives, physical collectibles like pet rocks/beanie babies/tulip bulbs, and digital collectibles like in-game skins/NFTs/cryptocurrencies, etc. Examples of cash flowing investments would be dividend stocks, direct ownership of small businesses such that net profits are available to you, or rental properties. It is important to note while ultimately supply and demand determine if a price for an investable object goes up over time, the underlying reason an investable object has demand at all can be wildly different from object to object. The reason some people want first edition charizards is usually a very different reason people want to own a stock of a company. It is within the eye of the investor to decide if the reason is a good reason, and hopefully a reason that leads to increased demand in the future.

So, what is a Ponzi? According to ChatGPT, a Ponzi scheme is “a fraudulent investment scam that promises high returns with little or no risk to investors. The scheme relies on using the funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors, rather than generating legitimate profit from actual investments or business activities. Eventually, the scheme collapses when it becomes impossible to recruit enough new investors or when too many existing investors try to withdraw their money at the same time.”

That seems like a pretty good definition to me! The part that everyone focuses on when thinking about a Ponzi is this part: “the scheme relies on using funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors.” This sounds extremely similar to my charizard example, yet I hope you have the intellectual honesty to accept that a real Ponzi scheme is different from buying low and selling high. 

The part that is extremely important, in addition to old investor returns being funded by new investors, is that the scheme PROMISES a return. The reality is that many Ponzi schemes do not start off as Ponzi schemes. There are sometimes investment funds that partake briefly in Ponzi-like behavior to paper over potential insolvency during a downturn, and then return to legitimate investment activities when the market improves. Doing this is quite risky and is still illegal, because if you aren’t able to essentially over deliver (and underpromise) on future returns to even things out, you’re essentially stuck in an endless cycle of repaying old investors who cash out with newer investor money, turning your once legitimate investment fund into a Ponzi scheme. The right move is to always be open and honest about what returns you’re able to achieve for your investors to avoid being stuck in the Ponzi-loop I described. 

Another attribute of Ponzi schemes is that Ponzi’s almost always violently collapse once the perceived value of the fund goes down. This is because once a Ponzi stops attracting new money, it becomes apparent very quickly that the liabilities of the fund far outstrip the assets. 

**Example 2.** Imagine a hypothetical Ponzi scheme. The Ponzi fund initially accepted $1,000 dollars from 10 eager investors in a local town. The fund manager promises a 10% annual yield so that in 1 year’s time, any of the original investors can withdraw $1,100, if they so please. Unfortunately, our manager really sucks at operating this Ponzi, and after 1 year, obtains exactly zero new clients. His liabilities at the end of the year are now $11,000, but he only has $10,000 of cash on hand. Even more unfortunately for him, Taylor Swift is announced to be coming to town and tickets are on sale now, and the tickets incidentally cost $1,100. All his investors want to cash out immediately so they ask for their money back. The first 9 that come to him are able to get their money back ($1,100 x 9 = $9,900). When the 10th person comes back, he realizes there’s only $100 for him, not the $1,100 he was promised! The fund not only has basically no money left, it owes $1000. The 10th person notifies the police, and our unfortunate fund manager is arrested for fraud. 

I will note that in this example, this scheme required 90% of the investors to withdraw for the scheme to collapse, but examples in history tend to be much more skewed, where even a small withdrawal of 1-5% of investors can completely collapse the scheme.

Returning to the investable object definition, once a Ponzi runs out of new investors to pay prior investors, the investable object completely disappears because the fund you thought was flush with desirable investable objects (that could be sold on an open market for hopefully higher than you originally paid for) actually had a negative cash balance the entire time! Behind the curtain, there actually was no object at all. This is in contrast to our buy low sell high example with the charizard card. The charizard market could hypothetically collapse tomorrow such that the market price drops from $10,000 to $1. Maybe everyone collectively realizes Pokemon is super lame, and that Yugioh is the superior card game. At the end of the day, there are two truths: you still own the investable object aka the charizard, and no one promised you a return for owning it. You can always wait it out, hoping that people become interested in charizards (and Pokemon) again. 

I hope this somewhat lengthy piece was helpful in elucidating Ponzi schemes for anyone that read this far. I often see CLEARLY non-Ponzi investable objects being echo-chambered as Ponzi’s on Reddit, when it really stems from a misunderstanding of the investable object, or the mechanics of investment itself. If your investable object trades on an open market, and nominal gains are made through price increases due to supply and demand dynamics, it is almost certainly not a Ponzi. If nobody is promising you a return, it also probably isn’t a Ponzi. This does not mean your investable object itself is not a scam or a bubble. That determination should be made with your best judgment of the fundamentals that underlie the object itself. I will leave you with 2 final examples to illustrate this. 

**Example 3.** Tesla stock is neither a Ponzi (trades on open market) nor a scam (they actually sell cars, batteries, etc for a profit). It might be a bubble if you think the company’s market cap is too high for what its future profits will be.

**Example 4.** Nikola stock is not a Ponzi (stock traded on open market), but it was a scam. The CEO lied to investors about how functional the cars were (they weren’t), and how many they sold (pretty much zero).",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfy0q8/ponzi_spotting_a_laymens_guide_to_differentiating/

928,1hwbkje,2025-01-08 04:37:54,[Advice] Opinions on covered call strategy with NVDA.,"I currently own about 64 shares of Nvidia stock at about $114 avg price. I will probably have the opportunity to make a full 100 shares within the next month or two, and I’ve been considering doing that just to run a covered call strategy with it while continuing to hold NVDA long-term.

Would I be better selling calls weekly or monthly? 

From what I can see I should be able to generate at least $350 to $400 a month or so which would be up to $4800 annualized. 

As of now, I believe I would just periodically reinvest the money directly back into Nvidia to build the position long-term. I also do realize I will pay capital gains on the money received from selling the calls. I have a small business with many legitimate write offs to hopefully help with that part.

 I understand the concept more or less and have used the strategy in the past with moderate success on much cheaper stocks. I also understand that I can buy back, roll up down, etc.

929,198e3t7,2024-01-16 21:12:42,What industries are you most bullish on this year? Also what stocks / ETFs are you buying right now to hold long term?,"I’m paying close attention to a small number of industries in 2024 ranging from oil tankers to food supply-chain track & trace, however, lithium is at the very top of my watchlist.  
The lithium supply chain (prospectors, mines, refineries, et al) will be within the blast radius of massive tailwinds as the demand for lithium will continue growing at an expedited rate with a compound annual growth rate of 12% to 20% (depending on what you read).

  
EV’s are the obvious lithium catalyst driven by strict adoption mandates across the EU, US, and Asia. For context on this, a Tesla model S' battery contains around 62.6 kg (138 pounds) of lithium and roughly 2 billion EVs need to be on the road by 2050 for the world to hit net zero emissions - the demand / growth potential of lithium industry is something unprecedented. There’s not much to compare it with and no, it hasn’t been “priced in”.

  
Also, let’s not forget the impact of global relations on lithium and other base metal supply chains. We’re seeing a repatriation of the manufacturing base back to the western world which in this case will favour domestic and near shore lithium projects (Canada and Mexico will likely be the biggest beneficiaries of this).  
I’m currently placing my long term bets in the industry and am bullish on a small number of stocks:  
$ALB - My safety net play  
One of the biggest lithium juggernauts rn with an extensive global portfolio. They hold the title of largest provider of lithium for EV batteries in the world. Albemarle is on a path of industry consolidation via aggressive M&A (This trend is expected to continue in 2024 and beyond).

  
$LIFT.V - My parabolic growth play  
One of the most robust early stage lithium projects I’ve come across in Northern America. If you know anything about junior miners you know how drill test results play a key role in assessing the potential value of a company/stock. I recommend reading into these. Just by looking at publicly available drill hole data, I believe we could see a total resource of 60+ million tonnes, which would mean and estimate 1-1.4 million tonnes LCE resource. (Lithium carbonate equivalent). For context, anything worth 1million tonnes is likely to attract major institutional capital.  
Does anyone else share by bullish outlook? What are your 2024 lithium/metals bets?

**The magnificent seven “—returned 112% on average last year, versus a 12.5% gain for the other 493 names in the S&P 500”**

> Those omissions proved costly on the scorecard of Barron’s 2023 stock picks. The 77 companies featured in bullish articles returned 9.9% on average from the date of publication to the end of the year. Their benchmarks returned 12.7% from the same dates. The two bearish picks featured in the magazine moved in opposite directions, for an average gain of 30.2%.

William Goldman, famous screenwriter and novelist (Princess Bride, All The Presidents Men, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid,etc) wrote a book on his life in Hollywood with the tag of no one knows anything. This was directed at studio execs who couldn’t predict flops or hits or who would be a star and everyone was often wrong on their guesses. 

I was impressed that Barrons came out and showed their abysmal stock picking record and how if you blindly put your money in the leaders you would have crushed the so-called experts.

937,19az17m,2024-01-20 00:51:08,Just how big are the Magnificent Seven?,"This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I’ve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause. 

> These captains of the SS S&P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?

> Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&P 500 depending on which day you look at it.

> Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?

> Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&P 500, but make up close to a third of its value.

939,1hvvgf2,2025-01-07 16:36:04,The potential AI stocks in 2025,"When think of AI stocks, the first names that come to my mind is $NVDA and $MSFT. NVIDIA dominates the AI hardware market with its GPU technology, while Microsoft, through its partnership with OpenAI, has become a benchmark in the AI software space.

Meanwhile, Applovin ($APP) has excelled in AI-driven advertising, with its stock price doubling in November, attracting widespread attention. But beyond these giants, there are still many ""hidden champions"" lurking among the small-cap stocks.

For example, $BBAI, which focuses on defense AI, and UiPath ($PATH), specializing in enterprise automation, have garnered attention from the capital markets due to their deep market positioning.

But, I am currently eyeing on $BGM's recent stock price fluctuations.

Recently, BGM completed its acquisition of AIFU’s insurance platform, marking a significant step in its transformation into the AI insurance sector. AIFU’s “DuXiaoBao” platform, powered by Baidu’s big data, is a prime example of such integration. It combines Baidu’s 704 million monthly active users with AIFU’s 48 million insurance sales network. Currently, the platform covers over 16.8 million customers and 17.5 million households. With BGM’s integration of medical resources, the user base and insurance coverage are expected to expand significantly, driving explosive growth for the company.

Traditional insurance sales rely on broker networks, but ""DuXiaoBao"" is changing the game by using Baidu and AIFU’s deep data models to offer tailored insurance solutions. In the future, it might even analyze users’ lifestyle and health data to predict their health risks over the next 30 years and design personalized insurance products based on that. Imagine if AI told you there was a 95% chance you’d be sick in the next 20-30 years and recommended an insurance product accordingly—would you buy it? This “smart + privacy” insurance sales model is truly disruptive.

This approach bears a striking similarity to Tesla’s innovation: Tesla used vehicle data to personalize car insurance, disrupting the traditional auto insurance industry, while BGM is using big data to empower insurance products, revolutionizing the customer experience.

Looking ahead, BGM might even leverage OpenAI’s technology to take the ""DuXiaoBao"" platform global, offering personalized health and insurance services to users worldwide. This vision of globalization and technological integration opens up even greater growth potential for the company.

BGM’s market cap is currently just around $60 million, compared to insurance giants like Prudential (market cap around $21.7 billion) and Prudential Financial (market cap around $46.1 billion), which are dozens of times its size.

941,1hcqtr1,2024-12-12 17:51:03,Returning to active stock portfolio management,"I recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously. To reconcile this experience and entertain others, I want to reflect on the mistakes I made and the new approaches I’ve adopted.

But first, briefly, the story of my initial failure.

When I started managing my portfolio, I quickly learned about the S&P 500 but was convinced I was smart enough to outperform the market. Arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall.

In 2019, I flirted with Bitcoin, which initially delivered great returns. Encouraged by the hype, I also invested heavily in PaySafe shortly after its IPO, believing in its potential because “everyone” said it was going to be great. At the same time, I was doing a lot of day trading. Looking back, I realize I wasn’t trading rationally. I’d look at graphs and invest simply because I felt the price would go up. I was taking desirable outcomes for granted.

Although I made a few conservative and reasonable investments, their success couldn’t offset the losses caused by Bitcoin’s decline, PaySafe’s terrible performance, and my risky trading. After 18 months, my portfolio was down 40%.

The arrogance I started with made the loss feel devastating. I abandoned my investment account for several years.

When I returned to it a year ago, I discovered that the growth of my conservative investments, along with Bitcoin’s recovery, had boosted my portfolio to 20% growth from my initial investment. I sold everything and bought into the S&P 500, feeling that I wasn’t capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. This turned out to be a good action, as the S&P 500 performed very well this year.

Now, I feel I’ve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. 

To avoid repeating the same mistakes, I’ve set specific rules to guide me:

1. I Avoid Speculative Investments
I now steer clear of speculative assets like crypto, IPO stocks, or companies like Tesla. I want to be a disciplined investor, keeping my greed under control.  

2. I Reject Market Timing
I no longer believe in timing the market but instead focus on time in the market. I avoid trying to “buy low today and sell high tomorrow” because it’s too easy to confuse wishful thinking with reality. Paying attention to micro events can help to take advantage of daily fluctuations, but it requires too much time and still, offers uncertain outcomes. More often than not, it doesn’t pay off.

3. Focus on Debt-to-Equity
In the past, I ignored the debt-to-equity ratio. Now, I prioritize companies with consistent net income and manageable debt levels.

4. Limit Individual Stock Exposure
I cap my individual stock picks at 5% of my total portfolio. Previously, this rule would have forced me to find 20 or more stocks to invest in, leading to choosing assets that were just “okay” rather than ones I genuinely liked. Thankfully, with most of my portfolio now in the S&P 500, individual stock picks act as a good supplement rather than a replacement for the index.

5. Invest in Goods and Services I Value
My approach to stock selection has shifted. I now look for companies whose products and services I personally interact with and consider them of great value. If the companies also demonstrate strong financial performance and maintain a reasonable debt-to-equity ratio, they become my choice.

I hope these rules will help me sleep well at night, keep me from obsessing over financial news, and generate decent returns that complement the S&P 500.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hcqtr1/returning_to_active_stock_portfolio_management/

I have done lots of research into the company and it’s finances and have used multiple methods in order to determine an intrinsic value (including margin of safety) to find a nice entry price. The methods I have used are:

1) Discounted cash flow ($50.49)
2) Multiples valuation model ($31.81)
3) Graham’s valuation model ($179.41)

This is not to say that my valuations are correct by any means, and I accept there could be faults in my calculations. My concern is that Grahams valuation model has produced the highest IV by some margin. However, it seems quite reasonable given how Tesla stock has traded over the last few years that this could be fairly accurate. I just want some advice on how people would use these numbers. Would you:

A- Use grahams alone as a benchmark for IV

B- Try and find an average between all 3 models and use that as an IV value ($81 would be the average), but at the risk that the stock may never drop as low as this so I may miss out on the stock altogether

I still have a long way to go, but these are hard-earned learnings I thought of sharing. I will keep it as compass for remaining decades of my life. I hope, it can be of some help to you too in your own money journey.

**#1: Become financially educated.** Our schools and society don’t teach us much about money, so you must learn it yourself early on. Learn to earn, spend, manage, invest, and grow wealth. Personal finance is neither complex nor boring, so don’t outsource it. It only takes a bit of effort to master a few key ideas and practices. This little effort will massively reduce stress about money from your life.

**#2: Have a vision for yourself.** Plans don’t always work out the way we imagine, but being intentional helps. Visualize how your life would be like years and decades out. Your future image should come from a place deep inside of you, not from your ego. Don’t think of grandiose ideas about how big you will be one day. Instead, aim to be financially independent early so you can do things that add meaning to your life.

**#3: Choose right work.** Choose a profession where you can enjoy the work even when results are not visible in short-term. If you don’t know what that is, just follow your intuition. It’s your best guide. Don’t choose a role because it feels prestigious or offers little more money. It will take a long time to become at good at anything, so choose work that gives you energy. Getting this right is way more important than accumulating wealth.

**#4: Maximize your earnings.** Once you have chosen your craft, think about how you can maximize your earnings over time. Invest in yourself and over-index on learning new skills. Try to become a more valuable person each passing year. Most importantly, be in the right environment. There are certain markets — like different industries and geographies — that will compensate you much better for your skills. For instance, job in the Bay Area would pay a lot more for same engineering skills than most parts of the world. Make all effort to transition to the environment that’s best for you. That will compound your earnings, connections, and happiness in the long-term.

**#5: Spend way less than you earn.** There is no shame in living frugally, especially in early part of your career. Aim for savings rate north of 20%. If you do that, you will keep more and need less to be financially independent. Deeply ingrain the idea that happiness does not have a lot to do with money. Precious things in life are free anyways, be it spending time with loved ones or losing yourself in your craft.

**#6: Invest in fast growing assets.** You will become wealthy when you own assets that can grow fast in value, like real estate or stocks. Stocks are volatile, but easier to manage. Real estate is more stable, but requires oversight. If you don’t want to manage individual stocks, buy diversified index funds. The key is to buy and hold for the long-term and let the growth compound. Things that don’t generate cash, like gold and bitcoin, are speculative. Play around with it if you want, but don’t make it the centerpiece of your investing strategy.

**#7: Aim for a few big hits.** There are a few asymmetrical bets that can have massive payoff. You can start a company or a join an early-stage startup with equity. You can start a side business or become a creator to share useful content with the world. You can even invest in undervalued stocks or real estate. These bets can take many forms. The odds of success of any one is low, but you can try as many times as you want. All you need is one big hit to change your life.

**#8: Know what you are chasing.** Play your own game. Do not compare with others because someone will always be in a better spot. Know when and what is enough for you. Don’t obsessively chase a target net worth number. Don’t revolve your life around a spreadsheet. Instead, know how much you need so can design a life you want to live. You will get lasting happiness only when you travel on your own path.

948,19efoht,2024-01-24 12:11:11,"Is China set for ""finally"" bottom and an epic rally?","DISCLAIMER: This post can disturb US readers:

  
What a f\* value evaporation we went through in the last years. China, with the bad press from the US major media and subsequently Markets realigning with US policy (decoupling) left the stock market in the lows. You have companies like $BABA that IPOed at $68 per share on Sept. 14, 2014, and last week this thing was touching that price. But let's compare BABA business and valuation quickly:  


|In Millions|2014|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|52,504 RMB or $8,463|868,687 RMB or $126,491|
|Profits|23,403 RMB or  $3,720 |156,906 RMB or $22,583|
|Share Price|\+/- 119$|\+/- 70$|

When China was friendly to the US eyes, the share price of BABA peaked at $300 and I remember that still it was considered a ""value play"" compared to its peers (FAANG or 7MAG)

China has disappointed the market with news (news from US media, reality is always different) and I beleive not a single news can disspoint investors further other than a very extreme US hollywood-driven wet dream of China invading Taiwan (it won't happen militarily, they follow a different policy with a period of 50 to 100 years planning and execution - as they work on long-term leadership, not 4 years elections circus)

Their economy is still doing better than ours in europe or the US, but they aren't active participants of press releases, conference meeting for the front page of Financial Times or election year where US population take it as a sport match.

* BYD took over TESLA. 
* eCommerce in China and South Asia is BABA/Tencent playground moving trillions
* They were the first to release 5G and subsequently US had to take them down with some drama story on Huawei

China state intervened their high growth sectors and companies bcuz their CEOs thought that they could monetise on Chinese publicly-funded resources and create an oligopoly equivalent to the US where Googles, Amazons dominate the citizens privacy, freedom and life. An order has been implemented where they will still exist, but won't cross lines with their algorithms as happened on our side - we are sorrounded by fake news, extreme division, teenagers suicide rate very high, adults depressed and anxiety, etc...

That story is over - I believe China is set to rally and this is the bottom (you read it here first). Recent news signalling this:

>BEIJING, Jan 24 (Reuters) - China's central bank announced a deep cut to bank reserves on Wednesday, in a move that will inject about $140 billion of cash into the banking system and send a strong signal of support for a fragile economy and plunging stock markets.

1. I'm not sure if I hold too many stocks in the same category (e.g. tech stocks) and most of them are already covered by the IWDA ETF.
2. I'm also considering holding only 1 or 2 high-dividend stocks like AbbVie, instead of 5 dividend stocks. Is it a good idea?
3. My long-term plan follows ""time in the market > timing the market"". So I plan to split DCA in half and put in ETF and stocks equally.

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

Prior to this event, I diligently followed numerous Twitter accounts in the Crypto space and was thoroughly following reputable Crypto YouTubers, intending to invest in crypto before the whole FTX incident unfolded. Little did I know that I was witnessing a significant dip and should have seized the opportunity to buy at that time.

Regrettably, I waited, hoping for an even greater drop so I could purchase during the ""real"" dip. Unfortunately, my hesitation was fueled by greed, leading to a missed opportunity. Reflecting on it now, I find it difficult to forgive myself for not capitalizing on the Crypto market during that downturn. I could have at least bought some and sold them today, at a profit.

Dealing with the daily realization that, as a first-time investor, I missed a massive chance is undeniably disheartening.

Moving forward, I'd like to ask what are some investments that could yield returns in the short-to-medium run. While I understand the stock market is often seen as a long-term investment, I'm not looking to invest with a huge amount at this time.

I have about 40K in savings right now. Here is the breakdown:

33K in a HYS (3.8 APY)

6K in a different HYS (6.5 APY but I can only add 2K per month so I have an automatic transfer from the 3.8 account into this one. Every year the money all gets kicked out in August so it's a constant cycle)

$750 initially invested right now (650 in VTI/VOO ETFS - 100 in Tesla Stock)

I have about 13k in retirement as well (70% low risk 30% moderate risk)

I only had to pay half of my college so that was really helpful but I’ve been working a lot of jobs and internships since 16 which helped too.

So I started investing 7 years ago and have seen an annualized return of 16.1%. I bought Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and others in the first couple years and have seen incredible returns from them. 

My question is if you would recommend I diversify any of my gains. For example I put 1k into Nvidia and now it’s around 10k. But now my stock portfolio is not that diversified because of some large gains between a few stocks I have are holding all the weight. Is there a threshold in the gain % where you start taking out and diversifying? For example, if I make 500% return on a given stock, anything over I would invest in something else.

I’ve been hip to investing for a few years now, loading up $50 here and there in companies like Tesla, Nike, Apple… you know the big companies. 

But I had several realizations as I’ve been continuously studying investing.

1. I DONT KNOW WHAT I AM DOING! $50 here and there into the companies I named is BS. I learned just because a company is in the news often doesn’t necessarily mean they have good financials (they turn a profit, steady growth, etc) 

2. NO STRUCTURE: $50 here and there is NO structure what so ever. I want to get to a place where I can invest $250 EVERY MONTH (I’ll work my way up as my income increases) not just 3 or 7 months the year but 12 months. I want investing to be apart of my monthly budget and I’m serious about that expense just like I am my rent / car note. 

3. NO STRUCTURE (Continued): there’s no portfolio management, I don’t have a solid investment strategy.

So in a nut shell, I’m investing all wrong. I’m proud of my self for taking the steps to invest because majority of my blood line doesn’t invest but I am one of the ones that isn’t scared, I want to seek out the necessary information, and I want to apply it. 

So that being me to my questions.

• how do I find a solid investment advisor/ CFA? 
• what exactly do I look for? I’m sure there’s some bullshit advisors out there and I want to make SURE I don’t run into one. My generational wealth depends on the quality of my advisor. I’m just not sure how to do due diligence to even find the right person. This is way out of my arena. 

If anyone can offer advice, insight, recommendations, it would be much Appreciated.

This topic stresses me out so much because what if I really pick a sh!tty advisor and I don’t reap the benefits I want in my retirement. 

Thanks, guys!

I also noticed that a lot of charging stations are being focused on being formatted towards Tesla charging stations since there is not enough charging stations for other ev companies “supposedly”.  Making Tesla slowly more and more a monopoly of EV companies if they are the main charging station.  

With also information about that some generations of evs are not supported by previous generations like only generation 3 can charge them but not generation 1 or 2 which causes more issues upon EVs.

960,1bryqpo,2024-03-31 01:50:29,Frustrated with the amount of scammers in the financial space,"Hello,

It feels like almost everyone in the financial sector is a scammer sometimes. I know this isn't strictly true, but man the scammers are everywhere.

I was doing research on Sam Bankman Fried in the past week, and even when I searched for terms like ""financial scam"" or ""financial fraud"" or whatever the exact terms I used, I got results back from known scammers like Warrior Trading, who was going to warm me of frauds!

I clicked on a Youtube video from 60 minutes on Sam Bankman Fried, and I said to myself, 60 minutes won't scam me. And then Michael Lewis comes on and starts shilling for SBF. What the heck??

Didn't Michael Lewis write a book about toxic assets, which were then sold to investors as safe and AAA and then leveraged to the hilt, from various Wall St. banks and credit ratings agencies, in a combination of folly/stupidity and greed/fraud? The main question often was what percentage was stupidity and what percentage was scamming the public. That was The Big Short.

Here Lewis takes the side of someone who embezzled billions, freerolled the bezzle with an insane risky bet, recommended lots of shitcoins to unsuspecting investors, encouraged them to use even more risks with derivative bets on these shitcoins, and then outright stole what remained from investors to prop up his failing crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, which has lost billions in bad trades.

CNBC and Bloomberg are always hyping various scams. Elon Musk posts he will make a flying car at Tesla a few years ago, the stock jumps double digits on the news, and CNBC hypes it up. Then invite Michael Saylor to pump his crypto scheme even though he was a scammer way back from the dot com bubble. His firm had major accounting ""issues"" and somehow he is still not only CEO of his stupid company, but invited to pump it while he is dumping shares and has been selling consistently for the past six months or so.

I remember when CNBC was endlessly hyping Nikola and their electric truck and then a few weeks later that was revealed to be a scam and the truck towed up a hill and then a fancy promo is shot making it look like it's running on EV power and CNBC never apologized at all!

Don't get me started on WallStBets and RDDT or DJT. It's scams all the way down!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bryqpo/frustrated_with_the_amount_of_scammers_in_the/

I have just finished reading The Misbehaviour of Markets by Mandelbrot, and I immediately started looking for libraries in Python to do data analysis using his suggested metrics.

To my surprise, I couldn't find any. So, first question, did I not search properly? What do you use?

Therefore, I started developing mine :)  
But I am having problems with the Hurst exponent/scalability (it is utilized to evaluate the extent of long-term reliance in market predictability), I don't understand how to interpret the results or there is a bug in the code (less likely, or in the data).

964,1e48n4g,2024-07-15 22:45:27,Two Arguments for Nvidia Stock Going Down,"I found this video, which essentially makes two points why Nvidia Stock is going to face challenges soon. 

1. Concern: Nvidia is building data centers for AI, but these data centers can not yet be used by companies to meet actual end-consumer demands which would be necessary in order to create actual revenue. The idea is that the ""customer (of those data centers) has no customer"". Thus, it has created a bubble, similar to a real estate bubble where many houses are being built without having people who are actually going to live in it.

2. Concern: the author of the video creates some criteria for companies or stocks that are in the danger of a downturn, such as decelerating revenue growth, decelerating earnings growth, margins going down and a high starting valuation, leading to multiple compression.

(Actual Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tRZmfmc8uc)

965,19cfixe,2024-01-21 22:17:52,NVIDIA - 2023 Q4 earnings projections,"[The new 2023 Q3 figures come from a market analysis firm named Omdia (via Tom's Hardware)](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook):

*Meta and Microsoft, each purchasing 150,000 GPUs. Those two companies were responsible for 300,000 units, with the other 200,000 going to the rest: Oracle, Tencent, Google, and Amazon, Tesla, TickTok, Baidu, Alibaba.*  


***Q3 reported revenue was 18 bills. The reported 500k number seems to be true.***    


**Now the question is, who will be ordering another 500k batch in Q4? so that at least the Q4 result won't pale in comparison and won't be a disappointment for investors?**  


META to the rescue (Hopefully)! As Zuckerberg stated:

[*“By the end of this year, we’re going to have around 350,000 Nvidia H100s. Or around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.”*](https://www.pcmag.com/news/zuckerbergs-meta-is-spending-billions-to-buy-350000-nvidia-h100-gpus)  
, which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia, or he may *""find 2\*x H100 equivalent to compute""* to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power-to-output optimized ASICs chips like Google's TPUs.  

  
I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)  
Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.   
Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.   


Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.  


Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).   


The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.   


**\[Conclusions\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.  A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.

&#x200B;

***Let's sidestep to AI marker TAM topic,***   
   
[*Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion.*](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook)  
However, this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM (total addressable market) of services like ChatGPT.    


However, I try to speculate on [open numbers](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users), which have stagnated for the last 6 months.   


100 million monthly active users \* 10$ per subscription produces 1 billion in revenue.   
[The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/).    
A single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.     
2000 \* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.   
Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.   
No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.

  
Last note,

the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.

There is also the shoeshine boy effect of Joe Kennedy. Supposedly when Joe Kennedy started getting stock tips from his shoeshine boy, that is when he knew it was time to leave the market. Supposedly he just made this story up to cover for insider trading, but its still a good lesson.

I feel like a stock goes through certain steps. At each step the potential gain goes down while the potential losses go up. Is there a name for this process?

FWIW my money is in index funds, so I don't really know a lot about the psychology of the stock market.

But it would go something like this

- step one. Only insiders who work in the industry have specialized knowledge and they can use that knowledge to buy low. This would be examples of insider trading (which is illegal) or politicians like Nancy Pelosi buying stocks based on confidential government information about government policy related to publicly traded companies (which is legal, but should be illegal).

- Knowledge that is public, but is very esoteric and hidden. There is knowledge out there about a new technology, new policy, etc that will affect the stocks price but the only people that know about it are experts in the field. Its public knowledge, but only a handful of experts know the info.

- Knowledge that is public and fairly well known. Basically anyone with google can find the knowledge.

- Knowledge that is mainstream. The mainstream media reports on the knowledge.

- Knowledge that causes hype. I guess an example of this would be NVIDIA or Tesla. After a while there was massive hype in these companies, and the stock prices didn't reflect their P/E ratios. At this point the general public who have no knowledge of stocks jumps on the bandwagon and ends up losing money when the stock crashes. NVIDIA hasn't crashed, but it might. 

With each step, the knowledge of the stock becomes more public and the less informed the investors become. 

Its not a perfect system by any means. Bitcoin went through the last phase of the general public jumping on the bandwagon and crashed in 2021, but it recovered from the crash and is now worth more than it was in 2020. However bitcoin only went above its 2021 peak in the last few months. Bitcoin peaked at 61k in October of 2021, crashed, and only went back up to 62k in June of 2024.

986,1cnicsr,2024-05-08 23:10:10,NIO's Strategic Charge in the Global EV Market,"Investing in NIO, despite its current operational losses and significant debt levels, can be considered a forward-looking strategy, particularly for those who are bullish on the future of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable technologies. 

NIO's debt is largely a reflection of its aggressive investment in research and development, infrastructure, and expanding production capabilities. These investments are critical for gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market. By financing growth and innovation, NIO is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the global EV market, which is expected to grow substantially.  NIO is not just focusing on the Chinese market but is also eyeing expansion into Europe and potentially other international markets, giving it more growth opportunities.

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from fossil fuels to electric and hybrid vehicles. This shift is expected to continue due to the decreasing cost of batteries, improved EV infrastructure, and increasing societal awareness about climate change.

However the journey to other countries such as America does not come without challenges, especially with the  giant EV manufacturer Tesla running the show. Tesla has a strong brand presence in the U.S., recognized for pioneering the electric car industry and backed by high-profile CEO Elon Musk. Tesla's brand is associated with innovation, quality, and sustainability, aspects that resonate well with American consumers. NIO, while a recognized brand in China and some parts of Europe, would need marketing efforts to establish similar recognition in the U.S.  For NIO to compete effectively, it will need to differentiate its vehicles through unique features, possibly focusing on its innovative Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, advanced autonomous driving capabilities, and superior interior luxury, which are some of NIO's strong suits.

Tesla's extensive Supercharger network provides a significant competitive edge in the U.S., where infrastructure is a critical factor for EV adoption. NIO would need to either build its own charging infrastructure, form alliances with existing networks, or innovate around this challenge, perhaps by emphasizing its battery swap technology, which provides a full battery charge in a matter of minutes as opposed to longer charging times at a typical EV station.

Navigating the U.S. regulatory environment can be challenging, particularly for a foreign company amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and technology transfer. NIO will need to manage these aspects carefully, ensuring compliance with U.S. regulations and possibly facing higher tariffs or trade barriers that could affect pricing and competitiveness.

988,1axrow5,2024-02-23 04:32:34,"Healthcare ETF for HSA, specifically VHT","I saw a pretty interesting strategy the other day and wanted to hear the communities’ thoughts on it.

If you compare a common healthcare ETF, like VHT for instance vs the total stock market, the healthcare fund actually outperforms the total stock market and with less max drawdown. So better performance and less volatility. Will this outperformance continue? Maybe, maybe not.

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=5xXJ6wBNCXzqUi7OEIMyxu

However, the second part of this strategy is what makes it interesting: Investing solely in VHT in your HSA. The reasoning being if healthcare costs go up in the future, the main beneficiaries of that would be healthcare stocks. The gains in this would then be used to offset the cost of healthcare expenses in the future when you have to draw upon your HSA, probably retirement age or older.

It’s sort of a hedging strategy on healthcare costs. If the costs of healthcare goes up, the healthcare stocks benefit and your HSA will reap those benefits. If the costs of healthcare goes down or even extreme case, there’s universal healthcare, then the HSA is only a small part of your portfolio and you’ll already be ahead by the lower costs of healthcare anyways.

989,1b3zmhb,2024-03-01 17:13:05,"Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely too late","Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely Past -- Journal Report  
March 1, 2024 (Dow Jones)  
By Derek Horstmeyer  
Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.  
To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.  
The final list of named trends we researched was:  
\-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.  
\-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.  
\-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.  
\-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.  
\-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.  
\-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.  
\-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.  
\-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce  
Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.  
From first mention  
Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.  
For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.  
The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.  
Worth the ride, until...  
But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.  
Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.  
When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.  
On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.  
All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.

I'm 93/7 percent believe in Warren and Elon, meaning if they say 100 things, I will most like believe 93 or them 110%:

Although Warren Buffett and we must always do our best to surpass our heroes like all Olympic records are meant to be broken (coz' in part technology, rule change and medicine advances) or NBA stars like MJ surpassing their heroes and Warren Buffett is still the genius compared to 93.% of investors and traders (the remaining 7% are the other stars like Peter Lynch), he's also made a few mistakes (Amazon is the best example coz' he always insists he doesn't understand technology which is honestly not that hard to understand but may be hard to see the road ahead when the internet was democratized including made affordable for the common working man with a decent salary ala Henry Ford's speech):

granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:

a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that

b) or is it because it's personal coz' they had a little war on words in the interviews and on X/formerly Twitter?

If it's about a) then it contradicts with his being on the Left mindset (a democrat, I'm with team common sense by the way at the moment coz' it has clarity, consistency and specific solutions) coz' the Left is very unorthodoxed and sometimes even comically non-sensical, going way beyond common sense.

If it's b) that's even worse, coz' one's judgment must not be clouded as Graham and Warren have though themselves, big decisions must be logical not ruled by vibes and emotions.

Whether NVDA is overvalued or not is up for debate, I have been hearing on Youtube that NVDA will drop after stock split just like TSLA did.  Let’s look into some figures for comparison:

regarding NVDA, the current market capitalization as of June 2024 is around $3T. This valuation makes NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world by market cap, even higher than the peak valuation of over $1 trillion for TSLA.

In October 2021, TSLA PE ratio was quite high, reflecting its growth expectations and market enthusiasm. The PE ratio was around 250.96 at the end of September 20211, and it likely remained in a similar range throughout October. The forward PE ratio, which is based on projected earnings, was also elevated, indicative of the optimism about the company's future performance.

As for NVIDIA, as of today, the current PE ratio is approximately 77.182. The forward PE ratio, which considers expected future earnings, is around 46.823 (TSLA at its peak:67.57).

996,1c3y3ff,2024-04-14 16:52:25,"10 years ago, we discussed how we select stocks. Here's the 2024 version.","Hi /r/investing, roughly 10 years ago there was a great discussion about [how we select our stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ecl4v/how_do_you_search_and_find_good_stocks/).  I discussed my method - Trending Value - and that led to me sharing my results with many of you via a program I had written.  Well, that program broke and remained dormant for years... until now.

So what is Trending Value?  It's a method published by James O'Shaughnessey in his ""What Works on Wall Street"" book. During decades of backtesting, it generated over 21% annual returns with equal standard deviation to the total market.  It generated a lot of discussion and lead to [this follow-up thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eyx3r/how_do_you_select_stocks_contd_trending_value_see/). In my mind, this method resonates the truest... far truer than those who advocate watching the check-out lines at your grocery store to see which products are being purchased. The method, summarizing is the following:

When you run a screen for stocks with good P/E or P/B, what do you look for? You find a stock with a P/E multiple of 12. Is this good? Is this bad? Neither and both, without a frame of reference. O'Shaughnessey's method rates 6 key financial metrics for every stock against the whole market to come up with a cumulative VALUE BASED score. Those metrics are: P/E, P/B, P/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, and Shareholder Yield, which is dividend yield + stock buyback yield (i.e. equity returned to the shareholder in some way).

All 6 metrics are ranked 0-100, where 100 is the ""best"" ratio in the stock universe, and 0 is the worst. The top 10% of stocks will typically have scores in the 420+ range. They are undervalued relative to the rest of the market.

However, just because a stock is undervalued DOES NOT mean that it's a good buy. It could be facing legal action, failing drug trials, having a CEO that just went to jail, or other event that can't be reflected in these numbers. That's where momentum comes into play.

We take the top decile of stocks and reorder them by 6-month price momentum. Invest equally in the top 25, hold for a year, liquidate, repeat. The companies you buy are undervalued and the market is rallying behind them. Back testing, while not a prediction of future results, yielded a 21.2% average ROI with this method.

Of course, there's no screener that does this, nor is there a way to even view ""Shareholder Yield"" in one location.

When I started this 10 years back, [I used MatLab to solve this problem](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46816-oshaughnessey_v5-m).  Yes, MatLab.  Wrong tool for the job.  Thankfully, ChatGPT has turned even amateur hobbyist coders into useful contributors, and a python version has been born.

I'll post the results of today's run below.  Feel free to ask for a specific stock and I'll post the results of that ticker.  Keep in mind, it is filtered to Market Cap > $200M and the name of the method is Trending VALUE - your growth stocks (NVDA, TSLA, etc) are going to be viewed very poorly.

Edit: You'll occasionally see a value like ""10000"" for P/E or another field.  That means the value was either missing or negative.  This is to artificially just kill that field for that ticker.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1c3y3ff/10_years_ago_we_discussed_how_we_select_stocks/

Imma be honest, i dont know a lot about investing/finance so idek if the question makes sense to most.

I get that the salaries of ppl here are probably way bigger than mine, but i ask this question because I see individual stocks like aapl, nvda, tsla, etc. and i think ‘oh it would be interesting/fun to invest in stuff like that’ but ..i know I should like max out my 401k first yknow.

For me, it's Apple. It kind of happened accidentally as my other stocks experienced significant gains, and I decided to trim them, part of rebalance effort. I believe Apple has great potential in AI development, and I expected it to continue to rise.

I'm curious to know what you all have in your portfolios and the reasoning behind your largest holding.

Investing in upcoming stock splits - Chipotle, Broadcom, Sony.

I feel like this could be a good short-ish term play to try and capitalize on the splits. Open to thoughts on this. 

Other thoughts would be watching AMD as the stocks been hammered due to the alleged data breach, so keeping an eye on this and catching it during the dip could be good. I’m very interested in companies competing with Nvidia right now, such as AMD and intel which both have chips that claim to compete with Nvidias.

Also, reached my second goal of half a milli","I started investing in November 2017 and I was doing great during the bull run. Unfortunately everything crashed down in 2021 and I spent 3 years kicking myself thinking I should've just put everything on SPY and forget it. In the last few months I can finally say that my portfolio is beating the index again. At some point during December 2022 my portfolio was -35% while in comparison if I had put it on SPY I would still be positive. This traumatized me a bit and now that I am finally beating the index over the last 7.2 years I have three main thoughts:

1. Is the volatility worth it?  
2. I'm up on some names anything from 200-800% which makes them seem overvalued and makes me hesitate on buying more of those companies  
3. Feels like a 30%+ haircut can happen at any moment and Im just dreading when it comes. 

Summary:  
Portfolio is up 193% since inception (Nov 2017) sitting at 595K  
Breakdown:  
Tsla: 45%  
Pltr: 25%  
Btc: 17%  
Clpt: 6%  
Abcl: 3%  
Rest less than 5%: Beam, Clsk, Nvda, AMD, Meta

I think for now im going to either lower my average on the few names im still down or just slightly up and believe strongly like Beam or Meta OR just buy SPY and turn that into Tsla BTC or Pltr only if there is a big correction in those names.

Stocks make up 65% and the S&P500 makes up the other 35%. I should also mention I’m 21 which is why my portfolio is so risk heavy.

I’m well aware of the fact that the S&P outperforms the vast majority of individual stock pickers/mutual funds and I believe that in the long run the S&P will outperform my stock picks. I do the fundamental stock analysis on the stocks I pick but I’m no professional portfolio manager.

1024,1gl4brb,2024-11-06 17:45:54,What are your expectations for green/renewable energy stocks under a Trump presidency?,"I bought some FAN (wind) and TAN (solar) back in 2021, hopeful that energy stocks would do well because of growing environmental concerns and attempts to shift away from reliance on fossil fuels. Unfortunately, they’ve not been doing well at all. FAN has dropped over 20% since I bought it, and TAN has dropped over 50%. They’re pretty much the only stocks I own that have given me a long term loss 

Woke up today to a Trump victory and both stocks dropping by over 5% despite the rest of the market rallying. I know in part that might be due to people selling yesterday in anticipation of a possible Trump victory (I know I was thinking of selling yesterday, but the market closed before I made a decision), but I’m curious what people think about the more long term performance of green energy stocks?

I’ve been thinking of selling for a while, but so far I’ve convinced myself that the stocks are probably going down now because of high initial production prices, but that they’ll probably go up again in the future. However, I’m skeptical of them doing well under a Trump presidency, at least compared to a Harris presidency, considering how little priority Trump gives to environmental causes and renewable energy. Also the fact that a lot of solar panels come from China with high tariffs

VTI will outperform VOO by about 1-3% per year for the next few years.

Once interest rate cuts begin, the small caps that make up about 15% of VTI will start to perform well versus the stagnation they faced over the last few years due to lower borrowing costs, better risk appetite, etc.

**Returns over the last 1 year: VOO = 20.1% | VTI = 18.3%.**

**Returns over the last 5 years: VOO = 82% | VTI = 75.5%.**

1028,1999cex,2024-01-17 22:10:50,What market trends are you BULLISH on for 2024?,"Hey all! Just trying to familiarize myself with some of the most talked about investment opportunities in the market right now as well as potential stock picks for each. Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn’t wanna go overboard

**Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.

**GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining.

**Uranium (BHP, NXE )**The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape.

What index would have a higher risk/reward or are they talking about getting individual stocks? If I did do something more risky I’d only feel comfortable with a max of 10% in risk stuff so if someone could explain what is considered more risky I might just be able to make a more educated decision and decide if it is right for me and open a brokerage account for this purpose only.

1038,1huvcpj,2025-01-06 09:35:45,Mag7 - Personal experiment 2024,"**Hi everyone!**

In 2024, I decided to try a simple but consistent investment experiment: I invested **€10 per week** in the ""Magnificent 7"" (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA, and META). The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice, but I can’t remember when exactly (oops!).

This wasn’t my only investment, and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It’s not an allocation I plan to keep in the future.

**Results**:

* I invested a total of **€520** throughout the year.
* The current portfolio value is **€706.80**, which means a profit of **€186.80** (+35.92% return).

**Key Takeaways**:

* **Consistency works:** Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!
* **Stock selection matters:** The ""Magnificent 7"" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.
* **Patience is key:** I didn’t touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.

This was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.

It’s just my experience—not right, not wrong—just mine, and I wanted to share it with you!

**Discussion**:  
Has anyone else here tried investment ""experiments"" like this? How did it go for you?

From googling around there are services that offer something called ""direct indexing"" but I don't see why buying / selling a market proportional ammount should cost 0.4% / year.

I spoke with my adviser at Schwab today because I'm ready to redirect my monthly SIMPLE IRA contributions (\~$2666/month for my wife and me) from buying stocks to something else.

So, with all that in mind, I have a few questions:

1. **Feedback on SIP vs. 3-fund portfolio?** If I go with the 3-fund portfolio, should I stick with the Schwab options listed on the Bogleheads wiki, or is there a better way to choose the funds?
2. **Advice on moving $500K from SNAXX to bonds:** I'm ready to move half of the $1M in SNAXX to bonds in preparation for interest rates coming down, so I can lock in some good returns for the next 5 years. Any recommendations on what I should consider buying?

1045,1h0j1xi,2024-11-26 18:34:03,Opinions on my Long Term Portfolio,"Hello all, I am 20 years old living in the UK and started looking into investing around 3 months ago. I have not invested any of my own money as of yet but have created a pie on T212. I would be able to invest around £1000 per month give or take.

My current allocations are as follows:

VUAG 55%

VFEG 10%

NVDA 10%

ASML 5%

TSLA 5%

ENPH 3%

NEE 2%

PLTR 5%

IGLE 5%

Is there anywhere you would look to change, I am in for the long haul and am not bothered about short term volatility. I was initially worried about being heavily weighed in on Tech (NVDA etc) so allocated some towards sustainable energy along with having a large chunk in VUAG. Any suggestions are welcome, I have no-one in my real life that is involved in the stock market so have no one to talk to about this.

Target is to have enough money for her to have good start: college, school, business…whatever she wants to do with her life. That’s why I didn’t want to be stuck with a college saving account.

Her current portfolio:
- AAPL (40.66% of account)
- AMZN (1.24%)
- PYPL (1.82%)
- SCHD (25.82%)
- TSLA (4.77%)
- VOO (21.56%)

Return isn’t so great
- YTD cumulative return -2.44% (SP500 +10.12%)
- 1Y cumulative return +15.63% (SP500 +35.06%)

I made some bad decision in the beginning: invested so much in high growth stock and got burnt during Feb 2022. PYPL was one of them and that’s the only one I still keep until now. I feel like I’m failing her now.

Too much institutional and retail money is piled into the same trades, leaving markets vulnerable to cascading selloffs. 

Momentum strategies rely on positive autocorrelation (recent winners keep winning). Once negative returns emerge, negative autocorrelation sets in, driving sharp reversals as positions unwind.

Buy Put Options:
Target broad market indices like SPY (S&P 500 ETF) or QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF) AAPL, TSLA with expirations in 30-60 days to capture near-term downside.

Vertical Put Spreads (For Efficiency):
Example: Buy a SPY $460 put, sell the $450 put to reduce premium costs while maintaining solid downside exposure.

The Dow Theory divergence between the DJT (Transportation Index) and the DJIA has become undeniable. When the two indices realign, it typically happens through downside pressure.

Right now, markets are showing all the classic signs of an impending correction. As traders and investors, this is where we won’t miss inefficiencies. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hg4223/the_dow_theory_merry_christmas/
1052,1g4cmvs,2024-10-15 17:01:21,"""frontier tech"" portfolio ","hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:

* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.
* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.
* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.
* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.
* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.
* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.

ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:

**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN

* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:
* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here.
* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).
* 15% mix of these...
   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation
   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large
   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership
   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership
   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership
   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now
* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.
* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.

**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR

* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play.
* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.
* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.

**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR

* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:
* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.
* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.
* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.

**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.

ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.

1054,1h5wads,2024-12-03 19:49:45,Investment Advice- Rebalancing?,"I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.

I'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.

My main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)

  
**Current Accounts and Savings:**

  
Personal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.

Business Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. 

SEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?

ROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.

M1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.

Regular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.

Chase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.

  
Crypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.

  
So my currently contributions to all my accounts are :

  
SEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  
ROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  
M1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  
Chase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  
Crypto- $400 DCA into BTC  


I don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.

I'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. 

TLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h5wads/investment_advice_rebalancing/

1056,1dpbvd3,2024-06-26 22:44:53,Safe starting plan to get into Futures? As well as what to do with my ROTH? ,"Hello all, I am very confused on how to proceed from the position I am in, and so would really really appreciate some advice. I am 19 years old.

Firstly, for some background, I started trading maybe back in 2022, I put in about $2500 in a WeBull trading account and invested in a bunch of big names like AAPL, TSLA, LMT, etc. And I invested some money into some complete no name stocks that I saw on TikTok. By what I would imagine to be completely luck, these stocks actually did quite well and they have been in the green for some time now. But yes, I know not to take advice from TikTok lol.

Fast forward to now, I havent touched the account since then, and opening it I have made a return of about 16% with about $400 in total open P&L. Which I feel like is good? maybe? I don't know.

Anyways the reason I'm making this post is because I'm interested in short term profits, I have always wanted to get into options but to be honest it just seemed very tricky and like gambling, and so it's always been a ""I'll learn how to get into it later"", but a few days ago I heard about something called futures trading and it seems much more simple and I would like to get into it. I have a very superficial understanding of how it works, and so I was just hoping to ask a couple questions about it:

1. Should I trade futures through a prop firm? Especially if I am just starting out/don't have a trading strategy? Or would I be better off starting with micros & my own money?
2. On that note, how do I go about developing a trade strategy? Do I just watch a YT video on different strategies available and pick one? My friend told me all strategies will work if I just use discretion but tbh that just made me more confused lol
3. What should I use to trade futures? I have heard that Ninjatrader is good.

And the next topic comes to my Roth IRA through Fidelity. over the course of a few months back in 2022 I put $200 in it monthly and eventually stopped, mainly because I was confused what ETFs I should put my money in.

People have told me VOO > SPY, but then some others said $FXAIX > $VOO. Which, if any, is true? Should I invest in all 3? Also, is $200 a month enough? Should I aim to max for $6500 contributed annually? Does it really matter?

I realize this post is all over the place and I apologize, but it's all the more reason I would appreciate some answers and so that I know where to go moving forward. Thank you very much!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1dpbvd3/safe_starting_plan_to_get_into_futures_as_well_as/
1057,1ehnkfo,2024-08-01 18:11:55,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

Those have good return, so I have been buying IRA, since taxes wont apply until withdrawal in retirement. 

  
I understand how they will pay out the dividend in theory and actually I use similar strategy in SPY but whats the biggest risk here? 

My best guess is that individual stocks goes to 0, by which Yield Max ETF will go into 0, but it's hard to imagine that NVDA will go to 0 in any time soon, since they are dealing with big tech or big name stocks with good financial statement and pretty much too big to fail business (i.e: DIS/JPM) 

That makes me think there is virtually no risks but apparently, it sounds too good to be true, and I am getting cautious. Are there anything I should know on this kind of ETFs?

Got lots of great feedback, and now that I have digested it all - I'm looking to move on some of it and hoping for some followup great advice on how to best handle.  The gist of it was:

  
*$5M portfolio, heavily weighted in AAPL and TSLA (80%) with $1M cash. Commenters suggest diversifying into index funds or bond funds, considering the tax implications of selling stocks, and caution against over-reliance on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios due to its high cash allocation. Some recommend exploring municipal bonds for tax efficiency and using a more conservative investment strategy given my financial situation.*

What I've started the process of doing is moving some of the cash to VOO, VXUS and VXF at a 50/25/25 split.  I feel confident with that mix and my goal of turning this $5M into $10M in \~10 years seems possible.  That just leaves the stocks and figuring out how to best convert those over into the 3 funds.  Am I right in assuming that there is really no real trick to this other than to sale them at the rate of taxes I'm willing to incur each year?  Much of the AAPL and TSLA holdings are profit so they are gonna hit me the hardest.  If I'm right in that assumption - what not just pull the bandaid off and do them all now?  Is there any real benefit to doing them over several years?  I don't plan on selling everything, but do want to move the bulk of stuff to those 3 funds.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ey1gi0/next_steps_with_rebalance_and_growth/

I am currently holding 13 stocks with a portfolio total of about 30k. They are roughly about 2300 in each and I was thinking about trimming off 2-4 and just investing an ETF. I am 29 so some of my holdings are a little aggressive due to the logic of ""I have plenty of time to make up the money if one stock fails"" nontheless my holdings are TSLA, INTC, GOOGL, RTX ,CNQ, RMBS, MTDR, FCX, PLTR, RKLB, ASTS, MSFT, AND SOFI.

In the past ten years, TSLA and NVDA added heaps of value due to once-in-a-generation type shifts in the global economy (Electrification, The rise of ChatGPT-like apps). One more is due in the next ten years - humaniod-ish robots being as common as family cars.

It's somewhat counter-Bogleheads and old advice, but nevertheless, an opposing view is useful. Years later, the virtues of a S&P 500 fund were extolled when compared to expert stock picking in Berkshire Hathaway's 2017 shareholder letter.

I've been digging into a making a new portfolio for 2024 to build for a long term hold (5-10 year hold with no liquidation events before 5 years). My group of friends have a chat about picks and we landed on Palantir at $9 and are happy about that and also shorted TSLA around year end (thanks Elon) so no problems with small spec plays or ""contrarian"" takes. But those are the trading plays and not the long term ones. 

Amazon is one (I live in Seattle, call me biased haha) but stuff like AMZN and NVDA are ones we're believers in but wanted to ask a broader group. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ajqh24/starting_a_new_portfolio/
1074,19cab92,2024-01-21 18:41:26,Mutual 'Fun' for my 3yo Son,"So for my son's first birthday (three years ago) I thought it would be fun to invest $1K and see where it would be when he turned 21. I asked all of his relatives to pick any stock or whatever, and then I bought fractional shares to spread out the $1K. I have a record of each initial stock purchase price (people picked everything from stuff that was hot then like NET, SPCE and PLTR to things they thought he'd identify with as he got older like DIS and NKE). Others played it safe and picked mutual funds. Anyway, the 'purity' of the initial $1K is gone because I've added more money (in small amounts) as people have given additional monetary birthday gifts etc. So now I have an imbalanced mishmash. I've been putting the 'new' money in safe places -- specifically VOO, SPY and BRKB. The total is still only about $2K but over the next 18 years I expect to continue to put modest amounts in and I am curious what people think. Should I hammer one mutual fund or spread it around? I have small slices of these stocks:  
  
IMVT, CCL, SPOT, AFRM, ISRG, BABA, WMG, POOL, TWLO, MRNA, AAPL, BA, PBW, SYY, NET, ABNB, TSLA, NKE, ICLN, GM, NIO, PLTR, DIS, HAS, JWN, JMIA, SPCE, VXRT, NOVNQ.  
  
I don't want to dump anything because it will be fun as my son gets older to connect the stock to a relative he will get to know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19cab92/mutual_fun_for_my_3yo_son/

Then I look back at another position I started in 1997. Carlisle Companies.  Long term chart shows a split adjusted price of $0.71 in 1997.  Hard to believe.  
It hits home today because Intel has once again disappointed the market and is down 15% at the open.   Carlisle is up $12/share for some reason.  I point this out because, all too often, we concentrate on NVDA, TSLA and DIS, but the real wealth creation is in companies that we hardly know.  
I had screen shots of the charts back to 1996, but they can’t be attached.  Take a look for yourself.  

Maybe worth looking at boring companies that quietly grow over decades. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1buswl2/fancy_names_intel_vs_carlisle/

I recently opened a Roth IRA account on Vanguard and plan to invest anywhere between $200-$300/mo. I’m struggling to figure out what to choose to invest in. 30 (M).

 I already have a brokerage account with vanguard that has investments in VTTSX Retirement fund 2060 with roughly $4000 . I contribute $100 to that each month. I have $2700 invested into VTI and have 5 shares of TSLA valued at around $920.00

I also have a Cash Plus Account with $4600 that yields an APY of 4.7%. 

Some other information is I have a 401K through my employer that runs through Fidelity. I contribute 12% to that account and it has roughly $67,000 in it.  I did recently switch that over to a Roth….after becoming aware that was an option. 

Anyways just looking for some advice on how to manage that Roth IRA vanguard account. Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1akd4ss/roth_ira_advice_needed_please/
